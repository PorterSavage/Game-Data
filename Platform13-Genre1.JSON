      "description": "In 1981, a sequel to Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>.  This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

This helps in lasting the distance in Survival mode, but they can also be hit by on coming attacks from the enemy. ",

      "description": "A port of the arcade game, <i>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</i> is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the <i>Gauntlet</i> games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. \n\nThis version contains the characters and levels from <i>Gauntlet: Legends</i>, plus the new characters and levels from the <i>Dark Legacy</i> arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.\n\nThere are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. \n\nUnlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.\n\nWhile levels can be gained and characters saved, <i>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</i> is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.",

      "description": "Max Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.\n\n<i>Max Payne</i> is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, \"hardboiled\" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called <i>Bullet Time</i> - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first  Matrix movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.\n\nCutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs.

      "description": "A beat'em'up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around \"grooves\" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.\n\nThe \"EO\" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.\n\nPlayable characters come from the following games:\n<ul>\n<li>Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)</li>\n<li>Final Fight (Rolento)\n<li>Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega)</li>\n<li>Final Fight 2 (Maki)\n<li>Super Street Fighter II (Cammy)</li>\n<li>Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Akuma/Gouki)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha (Dan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Sakura, Shin Akuma/Gouki, Evil Ryu)</li>\n<li>Darkstalkers (Morrigan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter III (Yun)</li>\n<li>Rival Schools (Kyosuke)</li>\n<li>Psycho Soldier (Athena)\n<li>Fatal Fury (Terry, Joe, Raiden, Geese)\n<li>Art of Fighting (Ryo, Yuri, King, Todoh)\n<li>Fatal Fury 2 (Kim, Mai)\n<li>Samurai Shodown (Haohmaru, Nakoruru)\n<li>The King of Fighters '94 (Kyo, Benimaru, Chang&Choi, Rugal)</li>\n<li>The King of Fighters '95 (Iori)\n<li>Fatal Fury 3 (Yamazaki)\n<li>The King of Fighters '96 (Vice)\n<li>The King of Fighters '97 (Orochi Iori)\n<li>The Last Blade 2(Hibiki)\n<li>Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves (Rock)\n</ul>\n",

With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.",

      "description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.\n\n<i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.\n\nOnly two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.\n\nYour life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.\n\nOne of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.\n\n<i>Halo</i> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

Munch searches in vain for others of his kind: his entire race has been exterminated, since the Gabbit eggs (\"gabbiar\") is a delicacy, and their lungs have been used by the chain-smoking, powerful Glukkons to replace their own. The last of the Gabbits is captures by two Vykkers, owners of Vykkers Labs, where they conduct experiments on living creatures. The two implant a sonar device in Munch's head, concocting a plan to enslave him and use him to trap other animals. However, Munch discovers that the implant has given him new powers; using those, he begins to free the vicious Fuzzles, whom the Vykkers have been using in their laboratories, hoping to escape himself and help other creatures who suffer under the yoke of the Glukkons.\n\n<i>Munch's Oddysee</i> is set in the fictional Oddworld universe; its events take place after those of Abe's Exoddus. The player controls Munch as well as Abe, the hero of the previous <i>Oddworld</i> games. Abe's abilities haven't changed much since the last installment: as before, GameSpeak must be used to communicate with other creatures, leading them to safety. His fellow Mudokons can now be ordered to attack enemies. Abe can also grab and toss Mudokons or Munch to lead them to area they cannot access otherwise. Possessing enemies also comes into play, and is needed to solve many of the puzzles. Possession abilities can now be used to ignite quarrels between enemies and make them fight each other. \n\nThe player can change between Abe and Munch instantly throughout most of the game. Munch brings on the table new abilities of his own: he can use his sonar to control or immobilize specific creatures, as well as swim. Another new addition is the possibility to use vending machines, which sell various items that enhance the abilities of the protagonists. At certain points Abe and Munch can also remote-control mechanical creatures.",

      "description": "After his father was murdered by a mysterious Chinese man known as Lan Di, Ryo Hazuki swears to avenge his death. After a futile search for Lan Di in Yokosuka, Ryo is contacted by Chen Yao Wen, a Chinese master who advices him to travel to Hong-Kong and seek out Master Lishao Tao, who might be the only one who knows what had happened between Lan Di and Ryo's father in the past. Ryo arrives in Hong-Kong and starts searching for a man who is his only link to the elusive murderer.\n\n<i>Shenmue II</i> is a direct sequel to Shenmue, continuing its story. The game's structure and basic gameplay elements are similar to those of the first game, incorporating elements of adventure, fighting, and light role-playing. Ryo explores vast 3D environments, talks to people to gather clues, and occasionally participates in fighting sequences. Like in the previous game, Ryo can train to become stronger in battles, and gradually learns new moves, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game.\n\nThe game's environments are based on real locations in Hong-Kong. The game world is significantly larger than that of the predecessor. The game also has a somewhat more linear story progression with numerous precise objectives, though free-form exploration is available during most of the game. Earning money plays a more important role, and many objectives are built around Ryo having to take part-time jobs (most of which are shaped like action mini-games) or participate in fights to win money. Like in the first game, Ryo can visit the arcades and play exact replicas of older arcade games, e.g. OutRun.\n\nThe sequel features a larger amount of characters who take part in the story. Some of them also accompany Ryo on his journey, helping him in fights or other dangerous situations. The game also noticeably increases the amount of quick-time events (QTEs). Several key sequences are composed entirely out of cutscenes during which the player has to rapidly press combinations of buttons in order to execute the correct action. Many major fights in the game also include extensive QTE segments, often serving as a culmination of the fight.\n\nThe Xbox version of the game comes with an additional DVD called <i>Shenmue: The Movie</i>, which contains a summation of the first <i>Shenmue</i> made into a feature-length movie.

The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).\n\nThe game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.",

Players also have access to Force Powers, which provide an advantage over their less talented foes. The player can force push an enemy, force grab their weapon, pick up an object and throw it at them, or force jump to high places.\n\nThe game has both a single player mode and a multiplayer mode called Jedi Arena, where players can battle with Jedi masters such as Mace Windu.",

      "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\n<i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, even those that never appear in <i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i>.",

      "description": "<i>007: Agent Under Fire</i> is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world.  Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch.  Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries.  Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands.  So James Bond sets off on another adventure...\n\nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher.  The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun.  There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.",

Gangs of misbehaving teens strap on rocket-powered roller blades and skate, grind, and mark their territory with graffiti tags.\n\nPlayers take the role of the GGs, and can choose between any member of the gang, each with different stats, while in gang HQ. The city of Tokyo can be leisurely explored without a time limit, but the heat will be turned up when story missions are activated and the GGs find themselves being challenged by rival gangs or under attack from the cops. This time around spraying no longer requires thumbstick inputs; just roll up and start spraying away, although large tags still require more cans than smaller tags. Each section of the city has hidden objectives that are revealed by finding a hidden tape, and once completed these challenges will unlock new graffiti patterns.\n\nIn multiplayer modes players can challenge each other to races, point battles, and other competitions both in zones from the single player game as well as in special arenas.",

The governor always wanted to protect her from the dangers of a pirate's life - especially after her mother disappeared without a trace. But when the ruthless Captain Hawke begins to terrorize the islands with his gang, the Crimson Guard, Katarina realizes she must find a way to stop him at all costs.\n\n<i>Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat</i> is an action game consisting of two main modes: sailing and land exploration. While sailing, Katarina's ship encounters hostile vessels and may engage in naval battles. The player must explore islands on foot to find special items that would unlock new areas on the map. Each island is a fairly linear area with respawning enemies hindering Katarina's progress. The player can also find keys allowing him to unlock treasure chests, and search for various items for collecting purposes.",

Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that's Pac-Man.\n\nUsing his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.\n\nThe game also features four classic <i>Pac-Man</i> games to unlock, all taken from different Namco compilations. They are, in order of appearance:\n<ul>\n<li>Pac-Man (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 1)</li>\n<li>Ms. Pac-Man (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 3)</li>\n<li>Pac-Mania (taken from Namco Museum Vol. 5)</li>\n<li>Pac-Attack (remake taken from Namco Anthology 2)</li></ul>",

      "description": "Following the events of Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, over 200 years the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Having lost his army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order and demands great things of it's citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears vengeance on the opponent who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as ruler of the vampires.\n\n<i>The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2</i> is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first <i>Blood Omen game</i>. The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and may move him in different directions, attack, jump, use dark gifts, and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.\n\nThe Serafan uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in <i>Blood Omen 2</i> involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it's connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.",

Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and descend while swinging and banking around buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the spider web.",

There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.\n\nOne notable feature of Burnout is the \"Burn Meter.\"  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.  If you crash, however the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve boost.",

The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.",

      "description": "<i>Dead to Rights</i> is an 3rd-person shooter in which the player is Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, he finds the dead body of his father. While trying to find the murderer, he is framed of another murder. Jack becomes a fugitive; his run from the law will take him  to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison, as an inmate.\n\nWhen controlling Jack, players can perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, or tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. If Jack does not have a gun drawn, he can disarm an enemy which causes him to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finish, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as the game progresses.\n\nPlayers will sometimes have to control Jack's best friend and partner, his K-9 dog Shadow, which allows enemies to be killed from a distance. In addition, Shadow will fetch their guns and bring them to Jack.\n\nThe game also features \"adrenaline combat\", similar to \"Bullet Time\" from Max Payne. Jack will then perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving him an advantage, as long as his adrenaline meter holds out.",

On the side of the Light, the Enclave was protected from all sides by a wide rift, a bottomless abyss. On the Dark side, twisted forms struggled for survival, while slowly growing more powerful, preparing to invade the Light side once again.\n\n<i>Enclave</i> is a third-person hack and slash game, pitting the player as one of twelve different characters on either side in this medieval era. As a member of the Light side, a Knight, a Huntress, a Wizard, a Druid, an Engineer or a Halfling can be chosen. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a Berserker, an Assassin, a Sorceress, a Lich, a Bombardier, or a Goblin. The player needs to perform different tasks leading ultimately to one objective; protect the Enclave (Light) or invade the land (Dark). To accomplish these tasks, various weapons, such as swords, bows, staffs and spears, can be used. To aid the player, shields are readily available, as well as a select few potions. Armor is abundant, and comes in many shapes and sizes.\n\n",

      "description": "Arx was a once a prosperous place. However, after one night the sun of the world of Exosta never rose again, and the blistering cold   forced their inhabitants into the dwarf mines. There, a new city was built, and humans, trolls, goblins, dwarves, and other races lived along peacefully, until the scarce resources proved to be too few for everyone. The animosity started to build up, and conflict between races ensued. The protagonist starts the game dazed out, being dragged into a cell by a goblin. Where is he? Why did he end up there? <i>Who</i> is he? With only that in mind, the adventure starts...\n\nInspired by the Ultima Underworld series, <i>Arx Fatalis</i> is a first-person role-playing game taking place in a vast underground world. All the locations and interconnected by passages, tunnels, and stairs, with eight levels altogether. Despite their dungeon-like appearance, locations also include populated settlements such as the city of Arx, where the player character can buy and store supplies, as well as other non-hostile areas. The player, however, is free to attack and possibly kill any non-player character encountered. While several main quests must be completed in a specific order to unlock a new area, the player can access and explore certain locations freely at some points in the game. There are no dialogue options, but some missions can be completed in different ways, and there are also a few side quests.\n\nThe player generates and builds up the main character by customizing his main attributes (strength, intelligence, dexterity, and constitution) as well as various skills, which include close or ranged combat proficiencies, technical skill for lockpicking and disarming traps, and others. Vanquishing enemies and completing quests yields experience points, which are converted to attribute and skill points when the protagonists levels up and can be allocated manually. Much of the combat in the game can be avoided, and the player may opt to develop a stealthy character, a spellcaster, a ranged attacker, as well as the traditional physical type. \n\nCombat in the game is action-based. The player can press down the attack key to build up force in order to strike more efficiently. It is also possible to execute several types of melee attacks by combining them with directional arrows. One of the unique aspects of the game is the spell-casting system, where the player uses the mouse (or the directional pad in the Xbox version) to draw the runes constituting a particular spell. The most complex spells can be performed by combining runes. Spells can also be readied and cast simply by pressing a corresponding key. Casting spells depletes the protagonist's magic points. \n\nAs some places lack light sources, players can take advantage of the darkness to stealthily move in the shadows, or use torches to lighten up a room to search for some object or find their way in a path. The game's world offers interactivity by allowing the player to pick up, drag, and place most objects. Food must be collected and eaten periodically to prevent the protagonist from dying of hunger. The player can combine various items to create new ones, as well as modify their properties. For example, it is possible to cook food, bake bread, use tools such as pickaxes and shovels, and brew potions.",

      "description": "Tommy Angelo was an ordinary taxi driver trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, until one day an unexpected meeting changed his life forever. Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice.\n\n Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.\n\n<i>Mafia</i> is an action and driving game set in the 1930's in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era.  Similarly to GTA games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.\n\nThe player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period.  Each car handles differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.\n\nComplementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious.  If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.\n\nTommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired in the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.",

Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.\n\n<i>Prisoner of War</i> can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game.

      "description": "<i>Run Like Hell</i> is a survival horror game.\n\nYou are Captain Nicholas Conner, a former pilot who works on a space station, involved in a project funded by the government.  You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race.  All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.\n\nThe game encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter.  You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened. Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small \"grunt\" type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you.  Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.\n\nIn a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times.  The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title.  When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked, and running is often the only option. You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.",

But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. \n<i>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</i> is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. \n\nTypically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. \n\nThe guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. \n\n<i>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</i> brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.

      "description": "Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. \n\n<b>Game Play Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Infinite Time</b> - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. \n\n<b>High Score</b> - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?\n\n<b>Icon Challenge</b> - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.\n\n<b>Career Mode</b> - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Push</b> - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to \"push\" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.\n\n<b>Head to Head</b> - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.\n\n<b>Time Attack</b> - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.\n\n\nThe Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.\n\nThe beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.\n\nThe PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.",

      "description": "Mat \"The Condor\" Hoffman and nine other world-class Pro BMX riders feature in this entry to the BMX racing series. Many gameplay features remain as before.\n\nWith the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.\n\n<b>Single Player Modes:</b>\n\n<b>Session</b> - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.\n\n<b>Free Ride</b> - Like Session, you can use this time to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick. Since this is the case, no scores can be saved.\n\n<b>Road Trip</b> - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Withine each level there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Modes:</b>\n\n<b>Trick Attack</b> - Compete against each other in a split screen competion to get the highest score you can in a certaon amount of time.\n\n<b>Free Ride</b> - Ride around showing off your stuff to your opponent.\n\n<b>Graffiti War</b> - Ride around and find the Spray Cans in the level, once you find them, perform a trick on the terrain. Once a stunt is completed your oppenent's screen  will be \"painted.\" The opponent can perform a higher scoring trick to clear the paint.\n\n<b>Tag</b> - The person that is \"it\" is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you're it score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.\n\n<b>H.O.R.S.E.</b> - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.\n\n<b>Treasure Hunt</b> - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.\n\n<b>Half Pipe Hell</b> - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.\n\n<b>Push</b> - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent's screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets push all the way off the screen.\n\nThe Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.\n\nThe locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.\n\nTo enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in.\n\nExclusive to the XBox version, you get to be able to ride in London, UK and have an extra rider - Chad Kagy.",

      "description": "There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.\n\nRayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.",

The mutants must save Forge before the Sentinels can coax secrets from him that are capable of destroying all mutant-kind.\n\n<i>X-Men: Next Dimension</i> is a fighting game in which the player can choose between up to twenty-four available characters. The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. Beside the basic blocking system, characters have various counter-attacks available, specific to the type of attack the player is countering. In addition to standard attacks, the player can execute super attacks by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. These include blasts or beams, some of which can stun an opponent, as well as physical attacks that have special effects. There are several different types of super attacks, each having four different levels of power.\n\nThe stages are rendered in 3D; unlike in most fighting games, many stages consist of multiple screens. The player can choose to move between these screens; kicking the opponent out of the current screen also leads to a location change. \n\nMost of the versions include the following modes:<ul>\n<li><i>Story Mode</i> - the player follows a scripted mode; only several of the characters are available to control.</li>\n<li><i> Arcade Mode</i> - a one-player mode where the player fights against the AI in a series of ten matches.</li>\n<li><i>Versus Mode</i> - a two-player game for one-on-one combat.</li>\n<li><i>Survival Mode</i> - a one-player game where the player tests his skills against a never-ending series of enemies, achieving as many victories as possible with only one life bar.</li></ul>\n<br>The GameCube version contains two exclusive modes, Team and Practice. The Xbox version features an extra stage and the ability to play as Pyro.",

Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.\n\nLike its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).\n\nThe Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Beginning where Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones left off, you must take control of either Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu or Obi-Wan Kenobi and lead the Republic Army against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nThe Clone Wars picks up with Mace Windu escorting the Jedi ambush to the Geonosis arena, which leads to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars.  After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var.  After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var.  They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon.  Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!\n\nThe Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.  Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles.  You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon.  Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.",

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the <i>Robotech</i> cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game.\n\nAs the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.",

      "description": "Electronic Arts' first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat'em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.\n\nPlayers, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. \n\nThe player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.\n\nSeveral levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.\n\nMost combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm's Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film.\n\nBetween the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine.\n\nThe game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.",

The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.",

      "description": "<i>Splinter Cell</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth, similar to the Metal Gear Solid series. The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of.  His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.\n\nTo get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.\n\nOther features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a \"snake\" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.\n\nThe Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube. The latter have slight changes in levels generally to make it a little easier. Each version also contains some exclusive features. The Xbox and PC versions include three additional downloadable missions (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack). The PS2 version has an exclusive level, and the GameCube version can be connected with a Game Boy Advance through a link cable to view an overhead map. The PS2 and GameCube versions include additional binocular items, and the latter also has an extra sticky bomb weapon. The PS2 release also has an exclusive 5min pre-rendered intro cinematic with full orchestrated score, showing how the two agents you are sent to look for at the beginning of the game were captured.",

The graphics are in full 3D and feature somewhat interactive environments.  Each character now has different fighting stances, allowing them to be in an offensive stance or a fatality stance.\n\nDA has over 600 unlockable extras, that are opened by earning \"koins\" that unlock \"koffins\".  The game also comes packaged with bonus material, such as the \"making of Deadly Alliance\" and \"the history of Mortal Kombat\".",

The princess was kidnapped by the evil dragon Singe and imprisoned in a medieval castle owned by an even more evil wizard called Mordroc. Now, it's only up to Dirk to use his courage and his quick reflexes to overcome the traps in the castle, if he wants to save the princess and his skin.\n\n<i>Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair</i> can be considered a re-imagining of the 1983 arcade game: gameplay-wise it deviates from it significantly, being a full-fledged action platformer with unrestricted character movement. Dirk has to battle enemies, jump across platforms and hazards, and solve a few puzzles on his way. Health and mana points can be upgraded over the course of the game. Dirk can also use a crossbow to combat enemies and solve some of the puzzles. Collecting Dragon Essences scattered through the castle grants him new powers.\n\nThe game features the familiar cartoon-like style of the original version (done with cel-shaded technique), as well as many familiar locations and boss enemies.",

Because his plans are so well hidden, it is up to Bond, with the help of Q and his gadgets, to stop Drake at whatever cost.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be taken to more than ten exotic areas, reaching all areas of the globe, confronting the beautiful Bond women.  In your quest to stop the Phoenix Corporation, you have have a variety of weapons available to you, from your trusty Walther to more advanced and prototype machinery.\n\nThere are twelve total missions, all of which combine stealth, combat, and Q's trusty gadgets, such as your laser watch and X-ray eye glasses.'\n\nThere are five levels which take place in your Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, and other exotic but deadly sports cars.

      "description": "<em>Steel Battalion</em> is a 'mech game in which the player takes control of mechanized tanks, known as \"VT\"s (or Vertical Tanks), using a forty button controller with footpedals.\n\nNot too far in the future, military unrest is rampant throughout the world, and the player has just recently been promoted. As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.\n\n<em>SB</em> comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.\n\nAn interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.\n\nTo defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.\n\nThere are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

      "description": "MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the \"Prime Jump\" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.",

Many years have passed since his work in New York, and he now works for the Century City Police Department (CCPD) in Los Angeles.\n\nYou are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy.\n\nThis game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game.\n\nThere are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.",

      "description": "Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the <i>Atlantis</i>, patrol this dangerous sector of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.\n\nThe first-person shooter <i>Unreal II</i>, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the Skaarj from <i>Unreal</i> and the Liandri Corporation from <i>Unreal Tournament</i> being major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions, taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge starship.\n\nThe weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two different firing modes.\n\nMissions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.\n\nThe story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments. Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the <i>Atlantis</i> and chat with his crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the main plot.",

Under a wave of attack, the prison camp is broken through by a mysterious dragon, and Orta takes it upon herself to ride the dragon, and destroy the Empire once and for all. Along the way, she will also discover her own destiny, and the mystery surrounding her new friend.\n\nSimply put, you have limited control of the dragon for most of the game, as your trigger finger will be shooting non-stop at the enemies that fly around the area. Orta will be your main source of fire-power when you simply press the fire button, but by pressing and holding, the aim cursor will change, allowing you to fire a burst of power from the dragon at whatever the cursor aims at. \n\nThe dragon itself can change into three forms at a press of a button. Each form has a different style of attack and power ability.\n\nA port of the original Panzer Dragoon is included.",

Those with limb damage will have their attacks decreased by 50%. The same thing goes for the legs except they can't run. \r\n\r\nFighters can also use the enviroment to their advantages, example fighters can flip off the walls, swing on poles or throw opponents through glass.

By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. \n\n<i>Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc</i> is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the \"shoot\" button. \n\nThe game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. \n\nRayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. \n\nRayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar. \n\nThere are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. \n\nThe Game Boy Advance <i>Rayman 3</i> links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are straight ports of the original game with HD textures and a smooth framerate. They also add nine short mini-games.",

The game is based on real events that were also depicted in a book and a movie \"Black Hawk Down\". First half of the game consists of varied missions that Delta Force soldiers had to engage into, like defending UN food convoys, rescuing hostages or destroying weapon shipments.\n\nSecond half of the game covers the events of the mission Irene on October 3rd, 1993. It's goal was to capture two lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and was expected to last less than 30 minutes, but after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, it took US soldiers more than 16 hours to return to safety. 18 US soldiers, 1 Malaysian and hundreds of Somalis were killed. A 19th SFC. Matt Rierson died two days later in an mortar attack.\n\nOn most missions the player works as a member of a small Delta Force team, working in co-operation with US Army Rangers or UN forces. Some missions include the player riding as a machine-gunner on a Humvee or a helicopter (including Black Hawks).",

      "description": "Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. \n\nBurnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost \"burnout\" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!\n\nBurnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  \n\nAlong with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.\n\nTraining and 2 player racing modes are also included.",

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.\n\nAs the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.\n\nAs was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

Niobe is a master combatant, capable of beating up everyone in her way.  She is an excellent pilot, both in the real world and in the Matrix. Ghost is very adept at firearms, and his marksmanship is a mastery.  Both characters are very athletic, and throughout the game the player will have to walk, run, jump, strafe, peek, run on walls, climb ladders and pipes, and fight various enemies.\n\nAvailable weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun and grenades.  Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws and grabs to kicks and chokes. Throughout the game,the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.\n\nThe game was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>.

And if you have a car that can race the distance, there's money involved too.\r\n\r\nThis is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities.\r\n\r\nEach race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first.\r\n\r\nEach race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You'll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.",
