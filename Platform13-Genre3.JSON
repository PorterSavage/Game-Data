The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.\r\n\r\nYour players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.\r\n\r\nAs well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.",

On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.\n\nAn interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.\n\nTo defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.\n\nThere are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

      "description": "MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the \"Prime Jump\" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.",

      "description": "<b>Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis</b> puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Hammond-type scientist, and challenges you to build a dinosaur themed amusement park.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences.  Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs.  While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping.\r\n\r\nYou have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths.\r\n\r\nYou can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie.  You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important objects is the Ranger Station.  With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters.  If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart.  If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.\r\n\r\nIn order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed.  The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be.  Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.\r\n\r\nThe different dino's require different resources.  Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows.  Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.\r\n\r\nThe game includes multiple camera angles.  You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter \"visitor\" cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.",

There are sixty challenges in all.\n\nWhen racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races.  Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember.  They'll try to get back at you in a future race.  Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you.  Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.\n\nLike the Football Camp mode in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,10021/\">Madden NFL 2004</a>, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.\n\nWith the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.\n\nThere are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.\n\nAs in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.\n\nTune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.",

Things have moved on in the rally-driving world, as they have with this, the fourth title in the series. This time the player is in the vehicle of their choice.\n\nWhile the game features improved graphics over the older titles in the series the biggest improvement is the handling in the game, which is now based on real-world physics. Where the previous titles' handling of the cars made use of one pivot point, the new physics engine has four pivot points, each wheel interacting independently of the others. \n\nThere are four championships modes: 2WD, 4WD, Group B and Expert. 2WD is for beginners. 4WD is the next step up, offering an intermediate challenge. Group B features cars from the '80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting. \n\nThere are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece. There are also over 20 cars to unlock, including the Team Ford Transit van.",

      "description": "<i>Karaoke Revolution</i> allows PlayStation 2 gamers to show off their singing skills and get real-time feedback on their performances.  It's similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but with singing instead of dancing.  \n\nPlayers sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved PlayStation 2 USB microphone devices).  The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing.  A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song.  If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes.  \n\nIf the player sings well, the crowd gets into the performance by clapping, cheering and dancing.  If the performance is bad, the audience becomes bored and the user can get booed off the stage.\n\n<b>Single Player Game Modes include:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcade Mode: where users sing 3\u20135 songs and try to score big points\n<li>Showtime Mode: Players start at a living room party and work to a huge concert at the Enormobowl.  Additional venues include: a subway station, The Pit Stop, a county fair, the Superstar TV show, Club Avalanche, and a royal hall.\n<li>Karaoke Mode: Players can enjoy singing the song without having to worry about bring rated or scored.\n</ul>\n<b>Multi-player Game Mode include:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcade Mode: 2\u20138 players perform songs and try to be the player with the highest score at the end of each round.  The player who wins the most rounds is the winner.\n<li>Karaoke Competition: 3\u20138 players compete against each other.  The main twist of this mode is that each player rates the performance of the other players to determine the winner of the Karaoke competition.\n</ul>\nOver 35 songs from the '70s, '80s, '90s, and current hits including (as made famous by):\n\n\"Addicted\" (Simple Plan), \"All You Wanted\" (Michelle Branch), \"Are You Happy Now?\" (Michelle Branch), \"Believe\" (Cher), \"Billie Jean\" (Michael Jackson), \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" (New Order), \"Broken Wings\" (Mr. Mister), \"Celebration\" (Kool and the Gang), \"Chain of Fools\" (Aretha Franklin), \"Complicated\" (Avril Lavigne), \"Crawling in the Dark\" (Hoobastank), \"Don't Know Why\" (Norah Jones), \"Every Morning\" (Sugar Ray), \"Everything You Want\" (Vertical Horizon), \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" (Cyndi Lauper), \"Hey Jealousy\" (The Gin Blossoms), \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\" (Pat Benatar), \"How You Remind Me\" (Nickelback), \"I'm Coming Out\" (Diana Ross), \"It's The End of the World As We Know It\" (REM), \"Kiss Me\" (Sixpence None the Richer), \"Ladies' Night\" (Kool and the Gang), \"Like a Virgin\" (Madonna), \"One Week\" (Barenaked Ladies), \"Red Red Wine\" (UB40), \"Save Tonite\" (Eagle Eye Cherry), \"Science Genius Girl\" (Freezepop), \"She Talks to Angels\" (Black Crowes), \"Smooth Criminal\" (Michael Jackson/Alien Ant Farm), \"Son of a Preacher Man\" (Dusty Springfield), \"The Power of Love\" (Huey Lewis and the News), \"Waiting for Tonight\" (Jennifer Lopez), \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" (Michael Bolton), \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" (Bette Midler), \"You Really Got Me\" (Van Halen), \"You're the One That I Want\" (Less Than Jake)\n\nPlayers can unlock extra characters, additional outfits, more songs, and behind the scenes videos.\n\nThe game includes an option for Expansion Discs - which means players will be able to karaoke to additional songs in the future.",

      "description": "Based on the TV show, this game takes various shows and lets you make the vehicle that was made on the shows.  For those who do not know the TV show, it works like this...\r\n\r\nJesse and his team are to build a creation that will do a certain task within 7 days and by spending under $3000 and the vehicle must look stock when completed.\r\n\r\nSo this game gives you the task of building a vehicle that does something such as drive through a swamp by floating on the water and using a large fan to make you move.\r\n\r\nIn day one, you must design the vehicle.  In the early scenarios, you only have one pre-made design to choose from.  In later scenarios, you can choose from three pre-made designs.\r\n\r\nDays two through six are devoted to constructing the vehicle.  You can buy various parts for the vehicle, but most parts will need to be fabricated.  To do this, you will need to purchase raw materials such as sheets of metal or metal rods and assign the task of making something like a roll cage to one of the team members.  They will make the item within a certain period of time while you handle other things. \r\n\r\nThings you need to do include removing parts from the vehicle or attaching parts to the vehicle as needed, and welding items to the vehicle or cutting items off the vehicle.  Every weld and cut is already set up for you and you just follow the line indicated.  Bolts are unscrewed or screwed on as needed.\r\n\r\nBy day seven, your vehicle will have to have been completed, or you will need to try again.  Day seven is used only to update the look of your vehicle.  This includes adding certain custom parts such as gold plated rims, painting the vehicle, and applying decals.\r\n\r\nOnce you are ready, you will take your vehicle to test it out and see if it works.  If you made it to day seven without being required to start over, your vehicle will work.  This is really just a test where you must complete a track in a certain amount of time.  For example, in one mission, you will have to make it around a snow-covered track in your upgraded car that has snowmobile tracks added to help with tracking within a certain amount of time.  You get as many tries as you need to complete this.  Once done, you can move on to the next mission.\r\n\r\nThe challenges of this game are to stay under the $3000 when buying/selling parts and to complete the track at the end.",

      "description": "Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series.  Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.\n\nMissions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the <i>Galactica</i>. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and <i>Galactica</i>'s war room.  Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.\n\nPlayers control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full.  Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.\n\nMissiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu.  Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.  This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.\n\nThough it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the <i>Galactica</i> itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.",

The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above.\n\nThe cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.",

Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals.\r\n\r\nHead out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for.  Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes.  Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you're going.  Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you.  Then take the shot!\r\n\r\nPlay the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online.  Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices!\r\n\r\nUnlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit.  Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don't forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy.\r\n\r\nPlay through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions.  Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.",

This is reflected in the car handling, the influence of the weather and the endless tweaking of the car set-up. There are eight officially licensed cars to choose from, with familiar names such as the Subaru Impreza, Citroen Xsara, Peugeot 206, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo and Toyota Corolla, but you need to unlock them by finishing school lessons, winning a rally or making it to the end of a season.\n\nNext to the usual training, quick races, rally seasons and multiplayer mode (only 4-player 'hot-seat'), you can test your skills in the Richard Burns Challenge, a time trial mode in which get the chance to go head to head with Burns himself. There are 36 stages in total, divided over six countries. The in-game music has been produced by Paul Oakenfold, Andy Hunter, Pepe Deluxe and the Plump DJs.",

Build friendships and business contacts with celebrities, political figures, musicians, sports stars and more through hosting events and charming over people.  \n\nOn the business side, Hef has to hire a staff to take photos and write articles for the magazine. The \"Playboy Photoshoot\" mode allows the player to take the role of photographer. On the personal side, invite friends into your inner circle, and find a girlfriend... or two.... or more. The better the parties Hef throws, the more fame he gets, as well as more interesting people to fill the magazine. More money means a larger staff, and more items (toys and furniture) for Hef to display in the Mansion.\n\nDoing well in the game earns Hef points which can be used to purchase extra features, such as cheats and archive photos of Hef and past issue covers.",

Jump in and let's go for a ride.\n\nThe game adds new gameplay elements to the system used in <i>MechAssault</i>. In the original game, the player was a Mech pilot and nothing else. Here, the player is the only pilot in the game world. This means that the player can now get out of a Mech and drive someone else's Mech. Want to drive a tank or some of the other vehicles? Well, now it is possible. Jump in many of the vehicles and take one for a ride. Of course, the Battlemech still rules the field.\n\nLike the original game, Xbox Live is fully supported for multiplayer gaming.",

Each type of car has its own unique feel and gives a different on-track experience. Real-life driver rivalries and confrontations are brought into the game with the enhanced grudges and alliances system. Computer drivers will remember whether you drive naughty or nice, and will payback favors in kind. The new Intimidator feature allows you to shake up an opponent by getting behind him and putting on the pressure.\n\nIn fight to the top mode, players can follow the career of their driver by starting in the Modified series and working their way up the NASCAR ranks. Performing well in races, as well as participating in autograph sessions, affects fan support, which in turn improves the driver's income.\n\nOnline support for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox allow up to four players to compete in a full 43-car field.",

The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.\r\n\r\nThe single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a multi-player mode with a number of different game types.",

      "description": "LMA Manager 2006 adds further detail to the soccer management series, with more players, more clubs and more playable leagues than ever before. A more complex transfer market, additional player stats and 3D training matches allow for more sophisticated management than in previous years. You can also now create your own manager model and see yourself marching along the touchline during a match, being interviewed at press conferences, and picking up awards at the end of the season.\n\nThe game starts with the pre-season stats for August 2005 but there was a process whereby the player could update their game by downloading a mid season database which was saved onto their memory card. The game can be played with real clubs or a fantasy team, it has two levels of difficulty and the AI staff can help with finance & training, just finance, or the player can handle everything themselves.<br>\nThe number of clubs is very extensive and covers the following countries and leagues:<ul><li>\nEngland - Premiership, Championship, League one, League two and Conference\n</li><li>\nScotland - Premiership, Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3\n</li><li>\nItaly - Serie a and Serie b\n</li><li>\nSpain - Liga 1 and Liga 2\n</li><li>\nGermany - Liga 1, Liga 2, Regional Nord and Regional Sud,\n</li><li>\nFrance - Division 1, Division 2, National\n</li><li>\nHolland - Eredivisie and Eerstedivisie\n</li><li>\nPortugal - Supa liga and Liga de Honra\n</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Steel Battalion: Line of Contact</i> is the sequel to Capcom's 2002 giant mech game Steel Battalion. Where the original game was an offline single-player campaign only, this game conversely offers only an online multiplayer mode with no single-player experience.\n\nThe original Steel Battalion game came with a unique and expensive controller sporting 40 buttons, 2 joysticks, three foot-pedals, and a gear-shift. In the US, Line of Contact does not come bundled with the controller so purchase of the original game is required for play. In Europe, you can either buy the game or a bundle that includes both the controller and the first game. In Japan, you can buy the game or a bundle with the controller included.\n\nOnline play is provided by Xbox Live and features four online modes: campaign, battle royale, capture the container, and conquest. Campaign mode (the primary mode for obtaining new mechs) divides combatants into one of four factions:  Pacific Rim Forces, Hai Shi Dao, Right Brothers, and Jaralaccs Mercenary.\n",

      "description": "TOCA Race Driver 3 follows on from the ideas started in Race Driver 2. The game attempts to include as many different forms of four-wheeled racing in one game, as well as injecting each with a high degree of realism.\n\nThe game has over 70 licensed cars and 80 real tracks, as well as 35 different disciplines of racing.\n\nThere are two main gameplay modes. The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D rendered cutscenes shown from the player's point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer's life aside from just the racing. This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines.\n\nThe second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has no back-story and longer, more realistic races.\n\nTOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an easier experience. This mode is also noticeably easier than the Simulation mode from TOCA Race Driver 2.",

If you accomplish these missions, you earn money which can be used to buy more planes.\n\nHowever, if you fail in a mission, you lose the plane you were flying in.  The only one you can't lose is the A-7 Corsair II you start with.  You must then buy a new plane and make your way back to the mission location.\n\nTravel across the world map is accomplished by spending movement points, which represent fuel.  There are checkpoints with paths between them which are populated by enemies.  Once you shoot them down, they stay down until you run out of movement points, at which point moving around becomes more difficult again.",

When uncle Mortimer is indisposed, he lets you take over running of five fabulous parks. The only problem is that Uncle Mortimer's arch nemesis Vernon Garrison is trying to knock Thrillville off the map with his Globo-Joy chain of multi-conglomerate parks and will stop at nothing to crush Thrillville like a bug and become number one. The only way to stop him is to keep the parks running smoothly, this involves keeping the guests happy and finding out their needs and wants.\n\nCreated by the team behind RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the game moves away from pure management for the console systems. You can construct your own rides and test them yourself. Daily chores require you to construct new attractions and stalls, and customers need to be kept happy with reasonable prices.\n\nInstead of crunching numbers, some daily chores have been turned into mini-games based on classic games. Using shoot-em-ups, racing games and rhythm games, mundane tasks become exciting events. You can even participate in the games available for your visitors. Instead of being a god, acting with an invisible hand from the sky, you control a park manager to distribute the work and interact with customers. You can even try to befriend customers through conversations to keep them happy.",

      "description": "NASCAR returns with a new roster of drivers and features in <i>NASCAR 07</i>. The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.\n\nThe main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.\n\nThis is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature: Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn. A few of the game modes are different.\n\nSterrance is featured on the US cover, as the driver for the #12 Alltel Dodge. The PAL release has Thomas's DeWalt Ford Fusion.",

Modes of play include: Campaign, Co-op, Free-for-all, Team Deathmatch, and Time Attack. Orders are issued to the team members by way of the controller interface or an optional voice recognition system with a communication headset. The game offers a variety of assault weapons plus tools, like night vision goggles.\n\nA new engine was designed specifically for this game to provide realistic shadows and a film-like appearance through the use of special filters.",

      "description": "<i>ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007</i> is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. \n\nThis only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.\n\nLess innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.\n\nThe game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.",

Along with the character parts, the character's voice is also pre-set. Creating a character is required to play, and only one player may play at a time. Once a character is generated, you may enter the casino, which you navigate by walking around, and is viewed from a third person perspective of your character.\n\nTable games (where you play against a dealer) include Blackjack (including Blackjack, Spanish 21, Double Exposure, and Triple-7), Caribbean Stud Poker, Craps, Let It Ride, Mini Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Roulette, Sic-Bo (similar to Roulette, except with three dice in a cage), and Three Card Poker. Machine games include Slots, Video Keno, Video Poker and Video Slots. Poker games include 5 Card Draw, 7 Card Stud, Omaha, Omaha 8's or Better, Razz, and Texas Hold 'Em. You may play the table and machine games by going directly to them to start, but you must go to the Poker Manager to play the poker games.\n\nIn addition to the Poker Manager, other features available in the casino include the Bartender, who is responsible for explaining the rules for the games, and providing tutorials for playing them. The Cashier will help you when you are out of money by providing markers, or letting you sell prizes won in tournaments. The Elevator lets you access your game play statistics, clothing options, prizes, and VIP status, and the Casino Manager provides information about prizes, handles VIP access, and allows you to enter tournaments. Competing in tournaments requires an entry fee of differing amounts, but if won, you gain all of the other player's entry fees. If you win consecutive tournaments, you win Tournament Bonus prizes which may be cashed in at the Cashier.\n\nAs your bankroll increases, you gain VIP status and corresponding VIP cards (Silver, Gold, and Platinum) which increase your ranking and unlocks an additional costume for your character. Gaining the High Rollers card just gives you the High Roller Ranking. These are collected at the Casino Manager's booth. You may access the menu at any time to go directly to a game, change system settings like music and sound volume, game settings and clearing game statistics, help to get detailed game rules and betting options, and to save and load your game.",

      "description": "<i>Pump It Up: Exceed</i> is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The <i>Pump It Up</i> dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.\n\nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the <i>Pump It Up</i> dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.\n\nThe game has several mode to choose from:\n<ul>\n<li>Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an  \u201cA\u201d or an \u201cS\u201d rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.\n<li>Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.\n<li>Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. \n<li>Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\n<li>Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\n<li>Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\n</ul>\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \n\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs.  As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.
