      "description": "This was the fourth and final version of the Championship Manager 3 game engine. The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.\r\n\r\nYour players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.\r\n\r\nAs well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.",

      "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\n<i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, even those that never appear in <i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i>.",

      "description": "<em>Steel Battalion</em> is a 'mech game in which the player takes control of mechanized tanks, known as \"VT\"s (or Vertical Tanks), using a forty button controller with footpedals.\n\nNot too far in the future, military unrest is rampant throughout the world, and the player has just recently been promoted. As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.\n\n<em>SB</em> comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.\n\nAn interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.\n\nTo defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.\n\nThere are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

      "description": "<b>Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis</b> puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Hammond-type scientist, and challenges you to build a dinosaur themed amusement park.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences.  Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs.  While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping.\r\n\r\nYou have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths.\r\n\r\nYou can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie.  You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important objects is the Ranger Station.  With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters.  If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart.  If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.\r\n\r\nIn order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed.  The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be.  Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.\r\n\r\nThe different dino's require different resources.  Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows.  Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.\r\n\r\nThe game includes multiple camera angles.  You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter \"visitor\" cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.",

The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs.\r\n\r\nUpgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.",

      "description": "A complete remake of the classic 1986 title <i>Defender of the Crown</i> (not to be confused with the \"Remastered\" Windows version released in 2002), in <i>Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown</i> the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.\n\nSeveral gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.\n\nAs with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:\n\n<li>The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood's eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin's trustworthy  bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.\n<li>If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee  by launching direct attacks on each lane.\n<li>Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents' own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin's imprisonment.\n<li>Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.\n<li>Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.\n<li>Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.",

The gods of the four Elements (Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind) inhabit an asteroid belt, the only remnant of their former world, which has been shattered to pieces. The gods are waging war on each other, each trying to reclaim the coveted throne of Gaia. Each of the gods represents an alignment: Light Order, Light Chaos, Dark Order, or Dark Chaos, ranging from the most benevolent to the most evil. Their armies consist of supernatural creatures. The player can choose to command any of the armies, taking it to victory through four campaign missions each.\n\nIn the game's campaign mode, the units are navigated in turn-based fashion over a board of hexagonal spaces, each representing a type of terrain. The main objectives of this strategic part of the game usually involve occupying the opposing army's temples or defeating specific enemies. When two opposing units meet on the same hexagonal space, a battle ensues. The battles take place on large arenas, and are a combination of real-time strategy and pure action. The player can take control of individual fighters and engage in direct arcade-like combat against the opponents.\n\nVersus and team fighter modes are available, both removing all the strategic elements, retaining only the action battles. Also included is an editor that allows players to create and customize their own soldiers and units.",

Play against friends in Link Duel Mode, or for a greater challenge, play in Triple Duel Mode where you need to beat all three opponents in order to gain your new cards.\r\n\r\nSummon your monsters and wage battle as you draw new cards to help you defeat your opponent.  Use spells and traps to increase your chances of success as you avoid your opponent's spells, traps, and monsters.  High-power cards do not guarantee victory.\r\n\r\nThe game comes with 3 limited edition cards: Dark Sage, Widespread Ruin, and the Egyptian God card: The Winged Dragon of Ra.",

      "description": "In <i>Full Spectrum Warrior</i>, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad.\n\nIn this game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.\n\nThe game takes place in one location, a Middle Eastern country, that is split up into several areas. You will have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the team leader, automatic rifleman, grenadier and rifleman, each playing a unique role.\n\n<i>Full Spectrum Warrior</i> supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.",

Build friendships and business contacts with celebrities, political figures, musicians, sports stars and more through hosting events and charming over people.  \n\nOn the business side, Hef has to hire a staff to take photos and write articles for the magazine. The \"Playboy Photoshoot\" mode allows the player to take the role of photographer. On the personal side, invite friends into your inner circle, and find a girlfriend... or two.... or more. The better the parties Hef throws, the more fame he gets, as well as more interesting people to fill the magazine. More money means a larger staff, and more items (toys and furniture) for Hef to display in the Mansion.\n\nDoing well in the game earns Hef points which can be used to purchase extra features, such as cheats and archive photos of Hef and past issue covers.",

It is the sequel of Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes, by Korean developers Phantagram which was released only for PCs with little success. The sequel combines traditional RTS gameplay with action elements in order to better accommodate console gamers and the lack of a mouse.\r\n\r\nMen (the kingdoms of Hironeiden and Ecclesia) and the Dark Legion (comprised of various evil fantasy races) clash for dominance of their world in a four part single player campaign. Fifty years have passed since the Second Great War of Heroes, whose events were described in the previous game. The Ancient Heart, the legendary artifact which caused the War has vanished, the war itself was forgotten and peace reigned over the land. Or so it seemed...\r\n\r\n The player assumes the role of commander for each of the four armies which take part in this war, and must lead his troops to victory by actually fighting in the battles and also by issuing orders to them. The hero accumulates experience points while fighting, thus increasing his skills.",

Each character has his or her own storyline.\n\nThere are more enemies to square up against on screen then any previous game in the series. The game uses the same graphics engine as the previous game. Changed for this edition are the bodyguards: they now do a better job of protecting the player character against the enemies.

      "description": "<i>Worms Forts: Under Siege</i> is a turn-based strategy game where 2 \u2013 4 people battle it out with a team of 4 worms with the help of weapons and forts. Each player takes timed turns bombing, shooting, causing natural and unnatural disasters, punching and blowing up the other opponent\u2019s worms. Each worm has a set amount of health and once that health is depleted or the worm drowns that worm is dead. \n\nNew to the series is the ability to construct buildings to aid in the fight. Build hospitals to resurrect dead worms, science labs to increase your firepower, strongholds to base your operations in and protect your worms, towers, keeps, castles and citadels to deploy weapons from there tops and weapon factories to produce multiple weapons around it at the start of each turn you take. Along with these typical building you can create Wonders in which your opponent has two turns to knock it down and if they don\u2019t succeed you win. If they in turn build there own you must destroy it to win the game.\n\nAlong with the typical <i>Worms</i>-style weapons like the mini gun, bazooka, rocket launcher, earthquake and homing pigeon (a homing missile in the form of a pigeon) you will also have weapons to destroy buildings like the trebuchet, fridge launcher, nuclear strike and the Trojan Donkey in which you get to place a Trojan Donkey where you like where it remains until it explodes, how long it takes to explode is not known. Some weapons like the Old Women and Rhino can be steered to your desired location upon which they explode on contact or exploded early by pressing a button. \n\nThroughout the game different crates will fall from the sky or teleport onto the playing field. There are four different types of crates: weapon crates (more powerful weapons); health crates (increase the health of a wounded or sick worm); utility crates, which carry instant utilities such as spy (see contents of all crates on the field), double time (doubling the time for your turn) and double damage (for one turn inflict double the damage); and collectible utilities like freeze (freeze your worms or building to protect them from damage for one turn), parachute (so your worm can safely jump from heights), jet pack (to reach distant locations and heights) and repair (to fix damaged buildings). \n\nSingle play allows for a quick game, tutorial, campaign, the trials (death match against the CPU) and the viewing gallery, which allows to view movies you have unlocked in the game by winning matches, how much of the game you have completed, check out the credits and look through the Fortapedia (a list of buildings available in the game and their descriptions). \n\nAs with the other <i>Worms</i> games, in multiplayer you have a plethora of options to choose from to set up a match against other people including allowing the CPU to play. Choose schemes (selection of pre-set weapons and game options), landscapes (the type of playing field \u2013 Roman, Egyptian, Samurai and Old World), Fortpot (a slot machine that randomly selects three game options from the many available), game settings (wins required, turn time, etc.), worm health and sudden death settings. \n",

      "description": "<i>Conflict: Vietnam</i> is the third game in Pivotal Games' Conflict Series this time taking you further back in time to the bloody battleground of Vietnam. The game is set during the Tet offensive in the year 1968.\n\nYou take over the role of four soldiers who aren't, contrary to previous games, elite S.A.S / Delta Force soldiers. In fact, they are normal American G.I. who are separated from their unit during battle  and have to fight themselves through enemy territory with hordes of hostile Vietnamese.\n\nYou can issue orders to every member of your squad or directly take control over one of them. In every mission you have one or more main and several bonus aims like destroying all tanks in  the area or collecting Vietcong documents. For each achieved objective, killed soldier or destroyed vehicle your soldiers get experience points. Each soldier has different abilities (Sniper, Leader, Heavy Weapons, Medic) which can be improved with these points. To defuse one of the numerous booby traps it is necessary to have skills in that ability.\n\nThe levels are set around the jungle and include underground Vietcong complexes or temples. You don't only meet enemies but also friendly persons like own soldiers or citizens with which you can talk and which sometimes give you bonus objectives. Furthermore, in some missions you can use stationary weapons like machine guns and drive jeeps or tanks.\n\nThe console versions of <i>Conflict: Vietnam</i> feature a split-screen multiplayer co-op mode with up to four players (Xbox) resp. two players (PS2). The PC version doesn't have this feature.",

      "description": "This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the World: in <i>Conflict: Global Terror</i>, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism.\n\nRather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels.\n\nThe combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.\n\nThe gadgets are useful and are frequently found to be helpful: thermal goggles let the player see through smoke, and Bradley's laser designator can mark key targets for gunship air strike. Claymore mines allow the team to protect their rear or even set up ambushes.\n\nThe game is very flexible - adopting all playing styles. Players are free to run and gun, or play as a super-stealthy special forces team. Players can play as one character leading the team, or switch around between characters as they see fit. Ordering the team about and switching characters is quick and simple. It is even possible to give each member advanced orders - \"On my signal, Connors runs to the window, Bradley opens the door and Jones throws a grenade through the window \". Ready....... GO!!! Conflict: Global Terror allows this kind of planning if the player wants to play that way. The co-op allows multiple players to take control of Red Team.\n\nThere are 4 difficulty modes and a skill learning curve for beginners an veterans alike. There are over 30 weapons with individual stats and behaviours. Each has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages - pistols are sometimes a better choice than a light machine gun for example, so the game aims to be more flexible to different playing styles.\n\nThe story unfolds throughout the missions and also in the cutscenes in between missions. The team really is made up of 4 distinct characters, with their own personal histories, lives and personalities.",

In the US, Line of Contact does not come bundled with the controller so purchase of the original game is required for play. In Europe, you can either buy the game or a bundle that includes both the controller and the first game. In Japan, you can buy the game or a bundle with the controller included.\n\nOnline play is provided by Xbox Live and features four online modes: campaign, battle royale, capture the container, and conquest. Campaign mode (the primary mode for obtaining new mechs) divides combatants into one of four factions:  Pacific Rim Forces, Hai Shi Dao, Right Brothers, and Jaralaccs Mercenary.\n",

      "description": "<i>Ghost Master: The Gravenville Chronicles</i> is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type.\n\nBy scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts.\n\nThe game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.",

When uncle Mortimer is indisposed, he lets you take over running of five fabulous parks. The only problem is that Uncle Mortimer's arch nemesis Vernon Garrison is trying to knock Thrillville off the map with his Globo-Joy chain of multi-conglomerate parks and will stop at nothing to crush Thrillville like a bug and become number one. The only way to stop him is to keep the parks running smoothly, this involves keeping the guests happy and finding out their needs and wants.\n\nCreated by the team behind RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the game moves away from pure management for the console systems. You can construct your own rides and test them yourself. Daily chores require you to construct new attractions and stalls, and customers need to be kept happy with reasonable prices.\n\nInstead of crunching numbers, some daily chores have been turned into mini-games based on classic games. Using shoot-em-ups, racing games and rhythm games, mundane tasks become exciting events. You can even participate in the games available for your visitors. Instead of being a god, acting with an invisible hand from the sky, you control a park manager to distribute the work and interact with customers. You can even try to befriend customers through conversations to keep them happy.",

Whether you play alone or with friends, you'll also be playing in the company of a couple of comic relief voiceovers that provide commentary, as well as dozens of co-eds out for spring break, who are more than happy to drop their tops off should they lose the questions. Their naughty bits are obscured by \"Guy Game\" logos, but depending on how much bonus score you get, you can remove the censoring from the clips and unlock them for uhm... further analysis.\n\nYou get bonus points by figuring out if the girls are going to answer right or wrong, what they answer, and also by betting on the outcome of mini-games where the girls compete in races, and assorted beach activities.",

The player can control any of seven different factions, each of which has at least one unique unit and its own set of sidebar powers:\n<ul>\n <li>California Commonwealth</li>\n <li>Pacifica</li>\n <li>The Republic of Texas</li>\n <li>Great Plains Federation</li>\n <li>The Confederacy</li>\n <li>New England Alliance</li>\n <li>The European Union Occupation</li>\n <li>Russia</li>\n</ul>\nThese factions wage warfare in different territories; the more territories are controlled, the more income a faction receives. When attacking such a territory, the player selects which of his units should be deployed. The battlefield is represented as a hex grid, though the graphics are full 3D. The objective of the battle is either to destroy all the enemy's units or capture enough objective towns to control the battlefield.\n\nApart from the campaign, the game provides both a single- and a multiplayer skirmish mode, allowing one-on-one battles.\n\n",

Six of the sub-characters from The Crusaders are now playable main characters in the Heroes, along with one new character Walter. Each has its own story campaign.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the predecessor, featuring action, RTS, and RPG elements. The player controls several troops, ranging from basic types such as infantry, archers, spearmen, and cavalry archers; to more advanced ones like siege units, mortars, aerial bombers, wyverns, giant scorpions, and mammoths. In Heroes, there are also four new elemental troops: ice maidens, earth golems, thunder rhinos, and flame wraiths.\n\nThe troops engage in RTS style combat, although commands are issued to entire troops instead of individual soldiers. When the troop led by the main character enters battle, the player fights enters 3rd person action mode. Each of the seven playable characters has its unique set of attack moves and combos. Some are quick and agile; others like the ogre Urukubarr are slow but powerful.\n\nAfter each battle the player enters the World Map and upgrades all of his troops with new skills, weapons, and armor. Hiring different officers to lead troops gives them special magic abilities. The player moves to different locations in the World Map to engage in new battles.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect has been significantly improved in Heroes to allow 3 on 3 strategy mode (The Crusaders supported 2 on 2), leader combat between only the playable characters, or co-operative mode against invasion from CPU controlled troops.\n",

The storyline takes place five years in the future - in 2008, the year the GST was formed. As team leader Mathias Kincaid, formerly with US Army Delta Force, players will lead his squad all the way from basic training to full blown secret ops. \n\nThere are 21 single-player and 10 multiplayer-only co-op missions involving search and rescue operations against terrorist factions. Modes of play include: Campaign, Co-op, Free-for-all, Team Deathmatch, and Time Attack. Orders are issued to the team members by way of the controller interface or an optional voice recognition system with a communication headset. The game offers a variety of assault weapons plus tools, like night vision goggles.\n\nA new engine was designed specifically for this game to provide realistic shadows and a film-like appearance through the use of special filters.",

      "description": "In <i>High Rollers Casino</i>, you navigate a Las Vegas style casino environment with a male or female character you create from pre-selected options (head, hair, etc.), or you may create a character with the mix and match generator. Along with the character parts, the character's voice is also pre-set. Creating a character is required to play, and only one player may play at a time. Once a character is generated, you may enter the casino, which you navigate by walking around, and is viewed from a third person perspective of your character.\n\nTable games (where you play against a dealer) include Blackjack (including Blackjack, Spanish 21, Double Exposure, and Triple-7), Caribbean Stud Poker, Craps, Let It Ride, Mini Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Roulette, Sic-Bo (similar to Roulette, except with three dice in a cage), and Three Card Poker. Machine games include Slots, Video Keno, Video Poker and Video Slots. Poker games include 5 Card Draw, 7 Card Stud, Omaha, Omaha 8's or Better, Razz, and Texas Hold 'Em. You may play the table and machine games by going directly to them to start, but you must go to the Poker Manager to play the poker games.\n\nIn addition to the Poker Manager, other features available in the casino include the Bartender, who is responsible for explaining the rules for the games, and providing tutorials for playing them. The Cashier will help you when you are out of money by providing markers, or letting you sell prizes won in tournaments. The Elevator lets you access your game play statistics, clothing options, prizes, and VIP status, and the Casino Manager provides information about prizes, handles VIP access, and allows you to enter tournaments. Competing in tournaments requires an entry fee of differing amounts, but if won, you gain all of the other player's entry fees. If you win consecutive tournaments, you win Tournament Bonus prizes which may be cashed in at the Cashier.\n\nAs your bankroll increases, you gain VIP status and corresponding VIP cards (Silver, Gold, and Platinum) which increase your ranking and unlocks an additional costume for your character. Gaining the High Rollers card just gives you the High Roller Ranking. These are collected at the Casino Manager's booth. You may access the menu at any time to go directly to a game, change system settings like music and sound volume, game settings and clearing game statistics, help to get detailed game rules and betting options, and to save and load your game.",
