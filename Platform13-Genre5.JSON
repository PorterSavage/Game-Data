      "description": "Midway introduces hockey with its no-rules twist that is seen in NFL Blitz.  Hockey may have fewer rules than football, but NHL Hitz features hard-hitting action and very simple 3-on-3 gameplay.  The game has franchise modes for a created team that you can design along with championship and exhibition modes.  You earn attribute points and credits that you can use to unlock items and improve your players along the way.  There are several mini-games and extras hidden deep in the game for you to unlock.  NHL Hitz is Midway's attempt at making the most action-packed hockey game to ever hit consoles.",

      "description": "This was the fourth and final version of the Championship Manager 3 game engine. The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.\r\n\r\nYour players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.\r\n\r\nAs well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.",

Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The \u00fcbertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six \u00fcbertricks in a row results in a super \u00fcbertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's \"It's Tricky\" to play. \n\nSeven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include \"behind-the-scenes\" footage and a \"making of\" segment.",

Players can choose between many snowboards, each licensed from a different sponsor of the game. The goal of the career mode is two rack up as many points as possible and rise in the ranking. This also rewards skill points which can be used to improve the player character's abilities.\n\nThe basic idea is that players find themselves on descending (and branching) courses, overall 120 in three areas, with many possibilities to perform stunts. Of course those are needed to progress in the ranking, but the game takes track of two different scores: the overall course record and media stunts in front of the press. Special events are sponsor races, in which the sponsors have to impressed during the whole race, and duels, in which the course progression of another snowboarder has to emulated and the point result surpassed. The game features a soundtrack of 150 songs along with the possibility to incorporate own music tracks.",

The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.\n\n<i>Outlaw Golf</i> pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.  The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.",

This is as arcade as it gets.  Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.\r\n\r\nGraphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents.  Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.",

The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called \"juice meter\": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a \"learning by doing\" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.\n\n10 pro inline skaters join the fun (Shane Yost, Sam Fogarty, Sven Boekhorst, Eito Yasuko and more), and you can take on a friend in 2 player split screen.",

Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. \n\n<b>Game Play Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Infinite Time</b> - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. \n\n<b>High Score</b> - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?\n\n<b>Icon Challenge</b> - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.\n\n<b>Career Mode</b> - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Push</b> - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to \"push\" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.\n\n<b>Head to Head</b> - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.\n\n<b>Time Attack</b> - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.\n\n\nThe Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.\n\nThe beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.\n\nThe PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.",

      "description": "Mat \"The Condor\" Hoffman and nine other world-class Pro BMX riders feature in this entry to the BMX racing series. Many gameplay features remain as before.\n\nWith the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.\n\n<b>Single Player Modes:</b>\n\n<b>Session</b> - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.\n\n<b>Free Ride</b> - Like Session, you can use this time to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick. Since this is the case, no scores can be saved.\n\n<b>Road Trip</b> - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Withine each level there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Modes:</b>\n\n<b>Trick Attack</b> - Compete against each other in a split screen competion to get the highest score you can in a certaon amount of time.\n\n<b>Free Ride</b> - Ride around showing off your stuff to your opponent.\n\n<b>Graffiti War</b> - Ride around and find the Spray Cans in the level, once you find them, perform a trick on the terrain. Once a stunt is completed your oppenent's screen  will be \"painted.\" The opponent can perform a higher scoring trick to clear the paint.\n\n<b>Tag</b> - The person that is \"it\" is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you're it score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.\n\n<b>H.O.R.S.E.</b> - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.\n\n<b>Treasure Hunt</b> - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.\n\n<b>Half Pipe Hell</b> - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.\n\n<b>Push</b> - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent's screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets push all the way off the screen.\n\nThe Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.\n\nThe locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.\n\nTo enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in.\n\nExclusive to the XBox version, you get to be able to ride in London, UK and have an extra rider - Chad Kagy.",

      "description": "<i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</i> is the fourth game in Activision's skateboarding franchise.\n\nThe main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.\n\nAll the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.\n\nThe levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.\n\nFor multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.",

      "description": "MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the \"Prime Jump\" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.",

      "description": "<em>Dead Or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball</em> takes all the female fighters from Dead Or Alive 3, sends them to a tropical island named <em>Zack Island</em>, and pits them in volleyball matches.\n\nAt the outset, you choose from one of eight characters, all female.  When you first play the game, the new character, Lisa, introduces you to a few aspects, and joins you for your first volleyball match.  All matches are two-on-two, with the first team to seven being the winner.\n\nEach day is comprised of four sections; morning, day, evening, and nighttime.  There are several different areas you can visit; separate beaches and jungles to challenge different teams, an accessory shop, where you can buy accessories such as sunglasses, a sporting shop where you can buy new bikini's, a store called \"Zack of all Trades\" where you can buy miscellaneous items, such as a gun, lipstick, lotion, etc., a radio station, where you can select what soundtracks to listen to, or listen to your own, and the hotel, where each day ends.\n\nOnce nighttime comes around, you can visit the casino.  Once there, you can play one of four games; Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, or Slots.  Playing games can earn you money, but can also strip you of money.\n\nThere is a large variety of items to collect, and some items you must buy to entice someone to join your team.  If a character's favorite color is black and her hobbies include cars, then you would buy them a black steering wall to pursuade them to join you.\n\nVolleyball matches earn you money (if you win) and consist of three basic moves; serve, spike, receive.  If you lose too many games, you're partner may ditch you.  Win enough and her loyalty will increase.\n\n<em>XBV</em> includes a multiplayer feature that lets you play against a friend.",

The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.\n\nDo well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. \n\nThere's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.",

Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.\n\nMultiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.

In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch \"On Fire\" and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated.  New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame.  The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game.  And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.",

Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility.

The fourth mode is Xbox Live enabled, allowing you to play with people over the Xbox Live service.\r\n\r\nThere are ten different courts to play on, each one with it's own backgrounds and animation.  You can play on a beach, at a carnival, or even in a prison.\r\n\r\n<i>Outlaw Volleyball</i> utilizes the same momentum feature first seen in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,6706/\">Outlaw Golf</a>, which allows you to earn \"beating tokens\" that you can spend on beating up the other team.  If you are doing lousy, beating up a member of the other team refills your momentum meter, allowing you to come back and possibly win.\r\n\r\nOver Xbox Live, the game supports voice chat and scoreboards, so you can see your ranking whenever and wherever.  It also supports downloadable content for future items.\r\n\r\n<i>Outlaw Volleyball</i> comes with a bonus CD that contains music from the band Diffuser, who is touted as \"Outlaw's official band\".",

This NFL adaptation boasts a comprehensive franchise mode that introduces some innovations in this standard mode.  One of these is a draft ticker, which puts your team on the clock each time it selects a player in the draft. With the draft ticker on, it is important to scout college players beforehand and analyze draft positions and team needs in order to preselect your team's draft candidates. In simulated games, NFL Primetime gives a variety of coach options. Here you can customize your team's aggressiveness level in offense and blitz tendencies and even set spies on more mobile quarterbacks for simulated games. Naturally, there are also obvious franchise mode options such as the ability to draft, trade, and sign/release free agents over multiple seasons.\r\n\r\nThe game also provides the standard football modes of exhibition and season play.\r\n\r\nThe cutscenes between plays give the game a TV-style presentation, which borrows graphics from the ESPN Primetime show.\r\n\r\nChris Berman and his Primetime sidekick, Tom Jackson, provide the commentary during games.

The most extensive mode in the game is the franchise mode. This mode allows you to play one season after another and comes complete with a draft and off-season player dealings, like signing and releasing players, governed by the real rules of the NFL, where trade deadlines and salary caps are standard.\r\n\r\nAnother new feature in ESPN NFL Football is a virtual apartment called 'The Crib.' The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game's menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.\r\n\r\nAnother feature added to this game is first-person football.  This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it's like playing on the field.\r\n\r\nChris Berman again adds ESPN style commentary for the audio track.",

This year's franchise mode includes an e-mail system that sends you notices about team injuries, current playoff statuses, and trade deadlines. Even simple words of encouragement are emailed from the team owner.\r\n\r\nThe skybox mode acts as a hub for the game's unlockables, stat tracking, and other random features.  There are two new gameplay modes in this year's game: skills and mini-games. Skills mode is a re-creation of the exhibition competitions held during the NHL All-Star weekend. You find a number of different competitions, including the hardest-shot competition, a shoot-out relay, a puck-control challenge, a fastest-skater competition, and a shooting-accuracy challenge. The roster of mini-games include pond hockey, mini-rink, shootout, and super-speed hockey.\r\n\r\nESPN NHL Hockey has plenty of unlockables, including classic jerseys, teams, and goalie masks. There are even a couple of unlockable mini-games.",

      "description": "Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in this edition of the series. The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize the players' physical appearance. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and \"pissed off\" animations for when you score a triple bogey.\n\nOne of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.\n\nA new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.\n\nAll top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.\n\nMost of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.\n\nLike all other 2004 EA Sports console games, <i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004</i> has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,10425/\">NHL 2004</a>.  This feature isn't on the PC version.\n\nGamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA's matchmaking service.  You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions.\n\nIf you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.",

You take on the role of GM for up to twenty seasons.  As GM, you'll have to negotiate contracts, conduct drafts, make trades, sign free agents, make sure your players are getting the training they need, and more.  If you're good enough, you may make it into the GM Hall of Fame.\n\nBesides Dynasty mode, you've got the basic game modes; Season, Exhibition, and Playoffs.\n\nThe control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games.  Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button.\n\nNHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights.  The right analog stick controls \"Bruise Control\", which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions.  Before you get into fights, you'll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in.  Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check.\n\nNHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game.  Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,10393/\">NASCAR Thunder 2004</a>) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums.  This feature isn't found on the PC version.\n\nIn addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany's DEL or Sweden's Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 and Windows versions of NHL 2004 support online play.",

Besides the season you can also play an exhibition game or just the finals.\n\nEvery one of the 16 teams and players from the 2002 AFL season is included, along with all of the usual rules that you expect for an AFL game. The game also features six stadiums and different weather (wet/dry) and time (day/night) conditions.",

Over Xbox Live, two players can face each other in a one-on-one match, while in a doubles game up to four players can join. Stats are recorded and rankings are updated hourly at XSNsports.com.\n\nThe game has a career mode that takes the player all over the world. The first step is to create a player and give him a technical mastery. Once in the game, the player may compete in various tournaments. There are games, minor pro games, and professional tournaments. Winning games earns money and a higher ranking. The goal is to go from rank one hundred to number one.\n\nFour different statistics can be gradually improved: serve, backhand, forehand, and volley. A higher skill will make for better and harder serves, more accurate and powerful back- and forehands, and the ability to keep the ball in play longer with volleys. There are also skills to obtain, such as risk and ace, which improves chances of hitting a successful risk shot or acing the opponent on a serve.\n\nIn Exhibition mode, the player may choose a created character or one of several real life pros, such as Pete Sampras or Anna Kournikova.",

Many real snowboarding tricks are including, from Indy's and Mute's to Stalefish's and Tailgrabs.  Specific to the sequel are kick flips and shove it's, as well as the ability to link tricks together via \"butter\", similar to Tony Hawk's manual.\n\nThe  career mode has you starting out as a level 250 nobody.  It's your job to rise the ranks and fight your way to number one in the world.  Challenges consist of beating a high score, beating media challenges, performing certain tricks in one run, finding and clearing all the gaps, and knocking down eight snowmen, who taunt you and laugh at you. When you're done with the normal goals, and your player is high enough, you can attempt Sponsor Goals and Photo Shoots, to earn new equipment and further unlock the mountain.  Some sponsors may like rails, so you'll have to use just rails to impress them.  The photo shoot has you performing tricks to get a set score while going through various rings on a set area of the mountain.\n\nOnce you're finished with single player, you can go online via Xbox Live to play with other people.  Your stats will be tracked and you can view your ranking, other player rankings, and where you stand at XSNSports.com.  Compete in races, stunt events, or just cruise the mountain.",

      "description": "The fifth game in the series, <b>Tony Hawk's Underground</b> is the first game to have a true career mode.\r\n\r\nYou begin the game as a local skater whom nobody knows.  Your board is wearing thin, and your tired of being a nobody.  As your out skating, you see a flyer for a pro who's coming to your city to demo.  You go to the skate demo and watch.  Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star.  With your friend, Eric, you're now on your way to becoming a legend.\r\n\r\nTHUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals.  You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple.  Eventually, you'll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii.  Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals.\r\n\r\nTHUG introduces a new system; walking.  You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level.  If there's a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down.  One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080's and up.\r\n\r\nAlso new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener's truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower.  These are used for goals, but can be unlocked to drive whenever and wherever.\r\n\r\nNext to the standard Create-a-Park and Create-a-Skater, you can now create your own decks and your own tricks.  The biggest feature is Create-a-Goal.  You can create custom goals for one of the levels (or your own), and choose what pedestrian will give it to you, his/her dialogue, and what they'll say when you win.\r\n\r\nThe PlayStation 2 version supports online play.",

Take them into a multi-season career, or individual tournaments or matches.\n\nLike EA's other 2004 games it has an in depth career mode, where you must manage your budget and team.  Promote players, demote players and renegotiate contracts, all in an effort to get your team to the finals again and again.\n\nThe skills to master range from kicked passes and headers to lob passes and bicycle kicks. You can take control of players before the ball reaches them, which makes it easier to find space to take the ball. Like other 2004 titles, <b>FIFA</b> uses the right analog stick for it's Freestyle gameplay.\n\nConsole versions use the EA Sports Bio, whereby you can continue to improve your gamer level and unlock rewards by playing other 2004 titles, such as Madden NFL 2004 or NBA Live 2004.",

      "description": "NHL Hitz Pro is Midway's 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.\r\n\r\nAs with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.",

There are stat overlays, pre-game, half-time and end-game shows, action replays, and various other animations.\r\n\r\n<b>ESPN NBA Basketball</b> has all the standard game modes, from quick game to practice, as well as additional modes, such as one-on-one and street basketball, where you can compete in a variety of games, such as being the first player to score twenty-one.  It also comes standard with franchise mode, which lets you lead a team of your choice to victory (or defeat) in multiple seasons.\r\n\r\nThe newest and biggest mode of the game is 24/7, which starts you off as a nobody basketball player in a local gym.  You must win matches to improve your stats (scoring two three pointers in a row will increase your long shot stat, etc.), and you have to take on \"bosses\" to get further.  Beat a \"boss\", and he'll give you his cell phone number, which you can then use to call him for help if you need a partner for a doubles game.\r\n\r\nThe game introduces the IsoMotion control systems, which is designed to help you pull off certain moves.  By moving the right analog stick, you can perform more advanced dekes, spins and fakes.  The IsoMotion moves also have an opposite effect, and using it too much may result in you being charged with a personal.\r\n\r\nBoth systems offer online play.  The PlayStation 2 lets you play on a narrow or broadband connection, and has PS2 only leagues you can take part in.\r\n\r\nThere are a ton of specials to unlock by completing various tasks.  If you make a total of fifteen double-double's, you can unlock a new team, or score five hundred points total to unlock some new music or background colors.\r\n\r\n<b>ESPN NBA Basketball</b> features all the standard NBA teams, including the New York Knicks and the Toronto Raptors.  There are also special teams, and the game gives you the ability to create your own player or team.",

      "description": "<i>Fight Night</i> is EA Sports' new boxing series, replacing the previous <i>Knockout Kings</i> line of games.\r\n\r\nYou have the option of creating your own personalized boxer, and entering a career mode, where you start off on the lowest rung in dirty, rundown gyms, as you make your way up the ropes to become the undisputed champion.  Throughout your career you will have to battle many enemies, all vying for the same title.  As you play, you will be able to train, improving your boxer's stats.  You can hit a punching bag to increase power and speed, spar with an opponent for more stamina and agility, attack the dummy to improve chin and body, or hit the mitts to improve heart and cut.  Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes.\r\n\r\n<i>Fight Night 2004</i> features the \"Total Control\" system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete percision over your boxer's moves.  The right analog stick controls all the punching, and the left stick controls movement and defense/blocks.\r\n\r\nThere are several unlockables available, all of which must be earned through career mode.  You can buy new clothes, entrance music, even new girls to accompany you to the ring.\r\n\r\nThe PlayStation 2 version of <i>Fight Night 2004</i> supports online play via EA Sports' online network.\r\n\r\nAs with all other EA Sports titles, <i>Fight Night 2004</i> utilizes the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your progress through all EA Sports games.  The more games you play, the longer you play them, and the better you do translates into a higher Gamer Level.  When you reach certain levels, you can unlock special rewards.",
