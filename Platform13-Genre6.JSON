There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.\n\nThe game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged.  Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.",

In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.\n\nThere are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.\n\nOne notable feature of Burnout is the \"Burn Meter.\"  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.  If you crash, however the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve boost.",

      "description": "Tommy Angelo was an ordinary taxi driver trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, until one day an unexpected meeting changed his life forever. Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice.\n\n Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.\n\n<i>Mafia</i> is an action and driving game set in the 1930's in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era.  Similarly to GTA games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.\n\nThe player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period.  Each car handles differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.\n\nComplementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious.  If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.\n\nTommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired in the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.",

Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.\r\n\r\nChoose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.\r\n\r\nThe competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.",

      "description": "MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the \"Prime Jump\" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.",

Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast.\r\n\r\nThere are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which tracks your progress over a period of time.\r\n\r\nThere are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nEach course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in combat.",

      "description": "Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. \n\nBurnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost \"burnout\" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!\n\nBurnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  \n\nAlong with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.\n\nTraining and 2 player racing modes are also included.",

And if you have a car that can race the distance, there's money involved too.\r\n\r\nThis is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities.\r\n\r\nEach race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first.\r\n\r\nEach race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You'll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.",

Paris is the more open ended city, great for beginners, while Washington features lots of narrow streets, sharp and hairpin turns, and various other distractions.\n\nThere are over thirty licensed vehicles to choose from, from a Lotus Esprit Turbo to a real-life garbage truck.  Each vehicle has it's own different characteristics, including speed, handling and acceleration.\n\nOver Xbox Live, you can compete in a variety of games:\n\nCapture The Gold -- Similar to Capture The Flag.<br>\nHunter -- Two players are cops, while the rest are normal vehicles.  When a cop rams you, you become a cop.  The last person left to be pulled over is the winner.<br>\nTag -- Same thing as the childhood game.

      "description": "<i>Starsky & Hutch</i> is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.\n\nLike the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky & Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.\n\nThe overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.\n\nDave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.",

Most of them are simple tracks, but there are desert tracks where the player can drive around freely, finding the checkpoints faster than the opponents. The player can choose from the officially licensed cars, trucks and bikes from Dakar 2002, but only vehicles of the same type can compete in a race. There is also an arcade racing mode, where all the tracks and vehicles that have been unlocked in rally mode can be selected, as well as a splitscreen mode for two players.",

Garage life is the main mode in the game. Here the player will race with any of the cars they have unlocked over seven levels, each with a different number of races. The player will need to finish first in some or all of the races to move to the next level. Winning these races unlocks new parts, items, and cars. In the garage, the player may customize the appearance of their car with stickers and body parts previously won. It's also possible to tune the car by adjusting brakes, suspension, tires, etc. \n\nThe US version of the game also supports on-line play (broadband only).",

Each character has a different level of ability (for example, one may be highly accurate in cornering but slow, while another is much faster but less responsive in turning).\r\n\r\nApart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).",

There are sixty challenges in all.\n\nWhen racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races.  Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember.  They'll try to get back at you in a future race.  Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you.  Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.\n\nLike the Football Camp mode in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,10021/\">Madden NFL 2004</a>, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.\n\nWith the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.\n\nThere are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.\n\nAs in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.\n\nTune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.",

The player will have to chase cars and find out where they're headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chase down villains before they get away.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts.\n\nAll voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144657/\">Dan Castellaneta</a> (Homer), <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001413/\">Julie Kavner</a> (Marge) and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0810379/\">Yeardley Smith</a> (Lisa).\n\nThe game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.",

Things have moved on in the rally-driving world, as they have with this, the fourth title in the series. This time the player is in the vehicle of their choice.\n\nWhile the game features improved graphics over the older titles in the series the biggest improvement is the handling in the game, which is now based on real-world physics. Where the previous titles' handling of the cars made use of one pivot point, the new physics engine has four pivot points, each wheel interacting independently of the others. \n\nThere are four championships modes: 2WD, 4WD, Group B and Expert. 2WD is for beginners. 4WD is the next step up, offering an intermediate challenge. Group B features cars from the '80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting. \n\nThere are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece. There are also over 20 cars to unlock, including the Team Ford Transit van.",

      "description": "Nick Kang is a young Chinese-American detective who has been suspended from the Los Angeles Police Department due to his extreme methods of policing and his ability to cause massive amounts of damage to property. However, Wanda Parks, the Chief of the E.O.D (Elite Operations Division), requires Nick's  assistance in a case that involves attacks on various venues in the Chinatown district. At first Nick is reluctant to help, preferring the vigilante life and focusing on avenging his father's death. However, he eventually agrees to conduct the investigation, on one condition: he must do it his way.\n\n<i>True Crime: Streets of LA</i> is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.\n\nNick can hijack any car on the street (usually with little to no repercussions) and freely drive through the 240 square miles of Los Angeles. Nick is capable of firing his weapon when driving; in an open top vehicle, it is possible to aim anywhere. The player can also opt for exploring the city on foot. Nick will be frequently contacted by other police officers and informed about various street crimes. He can then fight perpetrators, arrest them, knock them unconscious, or kill them to deal with these crimes.\n\nThe gameplay during the missions is separated into third-person shooting, fighting, and (more rarely) stealth sequences. All of these usually take place in relatively small, restricted environments. The shooting sequences involve Nick dealing with waves of enemies that appear in different places. Nick must react quickly, moving, crouching, or diving (with a \"bullet time\" effect) to avoid enemy attacks. A limited amount of painkillers can be found in such stages.\n\nDuring the fighting sequences, Nick utilizes his martial arts techniques to defeat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. Nick can punch, kick, grapple and throw enemies. The player can execute combos by pressing various combinations of buttons consecutively. It is also possible to pick up primitive melee weapons lying around, or take them from enemies. Both shooting and fighting stages have destructible environments.\n\nStealth missions typically involve Nick traversing a hostile area without attracting the enemies' attention; the mission is failed if an enemy hasn't been dealt with silently, or shortly after he has discovered Nick. The player has the option of killing enemies or knocking them down; the latter awards the protagonist \"good cop\" points. Conversely, \"bad cop\" points are given to Nick for killing innocents or surrendered criminals. Depending on Nick's rating in these categories, the storyline branches during later chapters, leading to different endings.",

Perform power slides, 360\u00b0 turns, drive on two wheels or stay in the slipstream of your opponents to build up a stash. With those points, you can unlock new venues and faster race monsters, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Porsche GT2, BMW Z4, Pontiac GTO, Mini Cooper S and many others.\n\nThe game can be played both over System Link as Xbox Live. You can race friends online or download ghosts of the fastest drivers all around the world to improve your own skills.\n\nEach city has its own soundtrack, but you can create and store your own playlists as well.\n",

      "description": "In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

In this game, the player controls one of 13 American Four By Fours through Hawaii, Moab, or Yosemite to be crowned King of The Off-Road. The player can race in a single, arcade race, take a complete free ride, or race in career mode. There are three kinds of racing to master: Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble.\n\nCircuit Races are exactly as they sound. The player howls around a course through checkpoints before time runs out at least twice.\n\nBlitz Races are considerably shorter than Circuit Races. The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B.\n\nIn Scramble Races the player roars around an area \"collecting\" checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible. These are the shortest races in the game.\n\nThis game can be played by two players.",

Prize money and prices have been modified as well, and new tracks, including a facsimile of Laguna Seca, reverse tracks, and races set in the morning, evening, and night, have been added to the returning races.\n\nThe player can jump right in the action by selecting a car, from a Chevelle to a Fiat, then a track location, from an American desert to a European village. In addition to the returning Chronicles mode there is also now a Gathering mode with 30 check point, license test, and racing line challenges. As with Chronicles each completed challenge unlocks a car for purchase in GT 2002 mode.\n\nOnline, players could participate in races with other human players, or trade parts with them.

The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above.\n\nThe cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.",

This game is very similar to it's predecessor, but now it appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks.\n\nThe trucks in this game are licensed likenesses of trucks you may see driving down the streets of suburban America.  You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster.\n\nThe career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2.  This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game.  For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses.\n\nThe GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.",

There are different competition types to test your driving skills including: Time Attack, Elimination, Racing Line, Driving Skills and more.\r\n\r\nYou select the amount of driving control you want. Standard gives you automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes and traction control. Choose Advanced for more precision driving with a manual transmission and more option selections. Learn the controls of the game in \"Quick Race\" which automatically selects a car for you and puts you on a pre-selected track. Then choose the \"Single Player\" to race with computer opponents or \"Multi Player\" for head-to-head competition with a friend. Select from different background music types (rock, funk etc.) to further customize your experience.\r\n\r\nViews can be toggled between 1st and 3rd person perspective. On screen in the first person view, the speedometer, tachometer, rear view mirror, are shown as well as a map on left side showing your current location and nearby competitors. Classic car dash panels differ from more modern cars, too. Depending upon your perspective, you'll see your lap times, overall position, rpms and speed.",

They are scattered throughout the intersections. Some pick-ups will halve, double or quadruple your score, cause massive explosions to cause even more damage, or increase your damage with monetary bonuses.\r\n\r\nSophisticated crash technology allows for high-speed crashes with extreme detail.  Use your vehicle as a weapon and takedown rivals, using the new Aftertouch feature to control your vehicle after the moment of impact.\r\n\r\n9 Race Modes including Single Race, Tournament, Lap Eliminator, Burning Lap and Road Rage.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer Modes include Quick Line, Battle Race, Road Rage, and Party Crash, where 2-16 players participate in a pass-the-controller match-up.\r\n\r\n7 Online Modes allow you to race online with up to 6 players.

      "description": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.\n\nThe missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.\n\nAs in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

      "description": "<i>R:Racing Evolution</i> is a racing game featuring several modes of gameplay:\r\n\r\n<b>Racing Life</b>: This is a single player story mode. You play the part of Rena Hayami who begins the story as an ambulance driver. After successfully racing the vehicle to the hospital, you're offered a chance to drive a racecar. Rena's saga to become champion and defeat her rivals will unfold in various cut scenes between races and driving challenges that you must complete. There are 14 chapters total. \r\n\r\n<b>Event Challenge</b>: There are a variety of racing events you can enter, each with an entrance few you must earn by winning previous challenges. You can also tune up your car or buy new cars.\r\n\r\n<b>Arcade Mode</b>: Here you can run a single race against computer controlled cars on the track of your choice. You can set several game options, such as the number of laps and rival cars.\r\n\r\n<b>Time Attack</b>: Choose a racetrack and car, and try to earn the best time!\r\n\r\n<b>VS. Mode</b>: This is a two player game. Choose a track, and two players race for either the best time or earn the most points.\r\n\r\nThe game features a variety of racing options you can set, including brake assist (will automatically brake for you if you enter a turn too fast), transmission types (automatic or manual), race difficulty, and adjustments to your cars performance. There are a variety of cars available, each with unique speed and steering characteristics. You can also unlock more cars by playing Racing Life and Event Challenge.  There is also a pressure meter: when driving behind another vehicle, you will begin to apply psychological pressure to the driver which is indicated by a meter above the car. When full, the driver will be very likely to make a mistake giving you an opportunity to pass easily! There is an instant replay option, and you can save your best (or worst!) races for viewing later on.",

      "description": "FlatOut is a driving game where crashing your car can be more fun than racing it.  You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics.  That last one may need some explanation.  When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat.  This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible.  On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is.  Simple as that.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode.  There are also two different handling modes for the cars.  Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads.  Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling.  Not surprisingly since Bugbear's previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.\r\n\r\nBugbear's experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut.  Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life.  Or at least as in a car-chase movie.  Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes are of course great party hits.  Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.",

      "description": "<i>American McGee presents SCRAPLAND</i> is a third-person 3D action game set on an asteroid called Scrapland, a ruined paradise rebuilt by robots, the only inhabitants now. The player controls D-Tritus, a self-constructed young robot that has just arrived Chimera, the main city. The adventure begins when he accepts a job as journalist and strange things start to happen...\n\nThe game is a mix between free-form outdoor levels and indoor levels with combat and puzzle-solving elements. During said indoor levels the player can instantly change his form between 14 robots, all with their own advantages and special abilities. Utilizing those robots is important to solve puzzles or mini games, e.g. only a tiny robot can fit into small spaces and only certain robots are allowed into the areas. However, those disguises can be seen through by certain enemy types. Then it is a good idea to change to a robot with fighting abilities - aiming is basically done automatically by the game.\n\nThe outdoor levels can be freely explored, but there is not much more to do then flying to next mission objective or indoor level. The parts of the space ship can be upgraded individually; better parts are gained during the game and by solving optional missions. The player can have up to nine different space ships and switch between them if needed - a heavy one is better suited for fights while a small one is useful for races.\n\nAdditionally the game features various outdoor areas which can be started outside the campaign and three multiplayer modes.",

The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at.\n\nWhile most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.).\n\nThere are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.",

      "description": "During the last years of his reign, the North Korean president Choi Kim attempted a reconciliation with the country's southern neighbor, with the ultimate goal of reunification. However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. \n\nThen the Australian Navy intercepts a North Korean freighter carrying nuclear weapons intended for sale to terrorist cells. In response, China, South Korea, the Allied Nations send troops into the troubled region to topple Song's regime. The Russian Mafia also bases itself in North Korea to take advantage of the situation. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.\n\n<i>Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</i> is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.\n\nPlayers have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted people in General Song's regime. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player completes missions for a faction, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck, although it is possible to track down the bounties without them. \n\nPlayers have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done.  It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.  Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes. ",

However, the prototype can't be designed individually - the player has to choose between between three designs per build. These differ in speed, brakes and acceleration. To keep with the theme, the player races to improve the sales figures, which serve the same purpose as ranking points in other action racers. High enough sales unlock new prototypes and car classes (roadster, speedsters, supercars and dreamcars). The game features 50 courses, various race categories and sometimes special challenges to solve.\n\nAdditionally to this dream mode, there is an arcade mode (single races) which can be played against another player.",

You can play Instant Action mode, in which you unlock these tracks one by one with indestructible cars, and Dynasty Mode, where you aim to build a more realistic career.\n\nWhat sets the game apart from the crowd is its approach to driver abilities in Dynasty Mode. When setting a driver up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to these.  \n\nFurther skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race.\n\nThe driver's heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen. Its length and efficiency are 2 of the skills which can be improved.",

      "description": "<i>Juiced</i> is a racing game, set in the fictive Angel City, that embraces the lifestyle and culture of street racing and tuning, similar to Need for Speed Underground, with slick, fully customizable cars, fast races, gaining respect and betting. The arcade mode offers quick races and in the custom mode you can set up events with unlocked cars and tracks. There are 52 vehicles from known manufacturers to acquire, and the game boasts a total of 7.5 trillion car customization possibilities. To make available all cars, tracks and parts, you need to progress in the career mode, where you build cars and participate in racing events to earn cash and respect. Aside from the traditional circuit and point-to-point races, there are also drag races (sprints) and show-offs with difficult maneuvers requiring advanced driving techniques.\r\n\r\nWhen you achieve acclaim in the career mode, some of the eight racing crews in Angel City will offer a position on their team. Each crew has specific challenges and crew racing introduces additional gameplay elements. You have to organize events by phone, gamble, and race opponents for their cars (pink slip races). The team leader's respect is controlled by the amount of damage given and sustained (distress, which also affects the car's performance) and your personal car collection. In team races, there is a strategic element as you can control your team members' aggressiveness in-game.\r\n\r\nUp to six player can race in the multiplayer mode, in which pink slip races, based on the car collection from the offline career mode, are also available. Statistics are organized on a world ranking server, with record times from singleplayer games and a rating based on your online performance. Ratings can be improved by beating higher-ranked players or multiple drivers in a single race.",

      "description": "<i>Forza Motorsport</i> is a racing game with extensive customizability, similar to the Gran Turismo series. There are 30 tracks and over 230 cars with a unique feel that can be modified to the smallest details, from spoilers to decals, and the option to create your own shapes with 100 different layers for a single car. Every single part influences the car behaviour - even the G-forces are taken into account, with a realistic damage model.\r\n\r\nThe game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with human opponents.\r\n\r\nForza also includes Drivatar technology, where you can train the computer AI to copy your driving skills (the way you approach corners, the amount of brake applied) and then let the AI race for you to move quickly past certain courses. Over Xbox Live, you can organize your own competitions, start a car club with a team of drivers, exchange cars, download ghost cars to improve your race times, compete on over 1400 leaderboards and acquire new car setups.",

Each type of car has its own unique feel and gives a different on-track experience. Real-life driver rivalries and confrontations are brought into the game with the enhanced grudges and alliances system. Computer drivers will remember whether you drive naughty or nice, and will payback favors in kind. The new Intimidator feature allows you to shake up an opponent by getting behind him and putting on the pressure.\n\nIn fight to the top mode, players can follow the career of their driver by starting in the Modified series and working their way up the NASCAR ranks. Performing well in races, as well as participating in autograph sessions, affects fan support, which in turn improves the driver's income.\n\nOnline support for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox allow up to four players to compete in a full 43-car field.",

Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.\r\n\r\nNext to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.\r\n\r\nCertain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.",

      "description": "The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by <i>impact time</i>, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.\n\nCollectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.\n\nIn the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.\n\nOnline multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.",
