When they were released, <i>Half-Life: Counter-Strike</i> could only be bought as a compilation pack containing both Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and the original <i>Half-Life: Counter-Strike</i>. However, existing players who only owned <i>Half-Life: Counter-Strike</i> thus received it for the additional platforms for free, even if they did not own the original <i>Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</i> or never bought the compilation pack.",

With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.",

      "description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.\n\n<i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.\n\nOnly two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.\n\nYour life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.\n\nOne of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.\n\n<i>Halo</i> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.\n\nThe game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged.  Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.",

      "description": "<i>007: Agent Under Fire</i> is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world.  Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch.  Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries.  Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands.  So James Bond sets off on another adventure...\n\nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher.  The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun.  There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.",

The governor always wanted to protect her from the dangers of a pirate's life - especially after her mother disappeared without a trace. But when the ruthless Captain Hawke begins to terrorize the islands with his gang, the Crimson Guard, Katarina realizes she must find a way to stop him at all costs.\n\n<i>Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat</i> is an action game consisting of two main modes: sailing and land exploration. While sailing, Katarina's ship encounters hostile vessels and may engage in naval battles. The player must explore islands on foot to find special items that would unlock new areas on the map. Each island is a fairly linear area with respawning enemies hindering Katarina's progress. The player can also find keys allowing him to unlock treasure chests, and search for various items for collecting purposes.",

      "description": "Freed by the decree of Uriel Septim VII, the Emperor of Tamriel, a lone prisoner is transported to the province of Morrowind. It seems that the strange dreams this prisoner has been having lately may have a connection to equally strange events occurring there. The protagonist is given a simple assignment: join the Blades, a secret organization whose goal is to protect the safety of the Emperor. This leads to a discovery of an ancient prophecy and an evil scheme concocted by a powerful deity whom the protagonist alone is able to stop.\n\nConceived in the tradition of the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, <i>Morrowind</i> is a fantasy role-playing game with a vast world open for exploration. After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. \n\n<i>Morrowind</i> uses a two-stage skill system. The hero\u2019s primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, while secondary abilities improve by use \u2013 for example, the more often the character jumps, the more proficient he or she becomes in the Acrobatics skill, etc. The action-oriented fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's hit points and condition were not originally shown; however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.\n\nThe protagonist's race and gender, but also his or her reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a character\u2019s sympathy for the hero is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer questions; if it is high, the player will get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick-pocketing, or simply by force.\n\nThe game's NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering. ",

There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.\n\nOne notable feature of Burnout is the \"Burn Meter.\"  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.  If you crash, however the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve boost.",

      "description": "Arx was a once a prosperous place. However, after one night the sun of the world of Exosta never rose again, and the blistering cold   forced their inhabitants into the dwarf mines. There, a new city was built, and humans, trolls, goblins, dwarves, and other races lived along peacefully, until the scarce resources proved to be too few for everyone. The animosity started to build up, and conflict between races ensued. The protagonist starts the game dazed out, being dragged into a cell by a goblin. Where is he? Why did he end up there? <i>Who</i> is he? With only that in mind, the adventure starts...\n\nInspired by the Ultima Underworld series, <i>Arx Fatalis</i> is a first-person role-playing game taking place in a vast underground world. All the locations and interconnected by passages, tunnels, and stairs, with eight levels altogether. Despite their dungeon-like appearance, locations also include populated settlements such as the city of Arx, where the player character can buy and store supplies, as well as other non-hostile areas. The player, however, is free to attack and possibly kill any non-player character encountered. While several main quests must be completed in a specific order to unlock a new area, the player can access and explore certain locations freely at some points in the game. There are no dialogue options, but some missions can be completed in different ways, and there are also a few side quests.\n\nThe player generates and builds up the main character by customizing his main attributes (strength, intelligence, dexterity, and constitution) as well as various skills, which include close or ranged combat proficiencies, technical skill for lockpicking and disarming traps, and others. Vanquishing enemies and completing quests yields experience points, which are converted to attribute and skill points when the protagonists levels up and can be allocated manually. Much of the combat in the game can be avoided, and the player may opt to develop a stealthy character, a spellcaster, a ranged attacker, as well as the traditional physical type. \n\nCombat in the game is action-based. The player can press down the attack key to build up force in order to strike more efficiently. It is also possible to execute several types of melee attacks by combining them with directional arrows. One of the unique aspects of the game is the spell-casting system, where the player uses the mouse (or the directional pad in the Xbox version) to draw the runes constituting a particular spell. The most complex spells can be performed by combining runes. Spells can also be readied and cast simply by pressing a corresponding key. Casting spells depletes the protagonist's magic points. \n\nAs some places lack light sources, players can take advantage of the darkness to stealthily move in the shadows, or use torches to lighten up a room to search for some object or find their way in a path. The game's world offers interactivity by allowing the player to pick up, drag, and place most objects. Food must be collected and eaten periodically to prevent the protagonist from dying of hunger. The player can combine various items to create new ones, as well as modify their properties. For example, it is possible to cook food, bake bread, use tools such as pickaxes and shovels, and brew potions.",

      "description": "Tommy Angelo was an ordinary taxi driver trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, until one day an unexpected meeting changed his life forever. Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice.\n\n Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.\n\n<i>Mafia</i> is an action and driving game set in the 1930's in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era.  Similarly to GTA games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.\n\nThe player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period.  Each car handles differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.\n\nComplementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious.  If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.\n\nTommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired in the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.",

But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. \n<i>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</i> is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. \n\nTypically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. \n\nThe guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. \n\n<i>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</i> brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.

      "description": "TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design's PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between.\n\nThe game's story finds Cortez, the series' hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.\n\nLike its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).\n\nThe Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills. \n\n\n",

After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var.  After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var.  They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon.  Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!\n\nThe Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.  Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles.  You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon.  Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.",

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the <i>Robotech</i> cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game.\n\nAs the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.",

      "description": "<i>Splinter Cell</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth, similar to the Metal Gear Solid series. The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of.  His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.\n\nTo get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.\n\nOther features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a \"snake\" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.\n\nThe Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube. The latter have slight changes in levels generally to make it a little easier. Each version also contains some exclusive features. The Xbox and PC versions include three additional downloadable missions (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack). The PS2 version has an exclusive level, and the GameCube version can be connected with a Game Boy Advance through a link cable to view an overhead map. The PS2 and GameCube versions include additional binocular items, and the latter also has an extra sticky bomb weapon. The PS2 release also has an exclusive 5min pre-rendered intro cinematic with full orchestrated score, showing how the two agents you are sent to look for at the beginning of the game were captured.",

      "description": "<em>Steel Battalion</em> is a 'mech game in which the player takes control of mechanized tanks, known as \"VT\"s (or Vertical Tanks), using a forty button controller with footpedals.\n\nNot too far in the future, military unrest is rampant throughout the world, and the player has just recently been promoted. As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.\n\n<em>SB</em> comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.\n\nAn interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.\n\nTo defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.\n\nThere are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

Many years have passed since his work in New York, and he now works for the Century City Police Department (CCPD) in Los Angeles.\n\nYou are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy.\n\nThis game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game.\n\nThere are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.",

      "description": "Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the <i>Atlantis</i>, patrol this dangerous sector of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.\n\nThe first-person shooter <i>Unreal II</i>, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the Skaarj from <i>Unreal</i> and the Liandri Corporation from <i>Unreal Tournament</i> being major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions, taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge starship.\n\nThe weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two different firing modes.\n\nMissions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.\n\nThe story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments. Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the <i>Atlantis</i> and chat with his crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the main plot.",

The game is based on real events that were also depicted in a book and a movie \"Black Hawk Down\". First half of the game consists of varied missions that Delta Force soldiers had to engage into, like defending UN food convoys, rescuing hostages or destroying weapon shipments.\n\nSecond half of the game covers the events of the mission Irene on October 3rd, 1993. It's goal was to capture two lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and was expected to last less than 30 minutes, but after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, it took US soldiers more than 16 hours to return to safety. 18 US soldiers, 1 Malaysian and hundreds of Somalis were killed. A 19th SFC. Matt Rierson died two days later in an mortar attack.\n\nOn most missions the player works as a member of a small Delta Force team, working in co-operation with US Army Rangers or UN forces. Some missions include the player riding as a machine-gunner on a Humvee or a helicopter (including Black Hawks).",

      "description": "<b>Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis</b> puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Hammond-type scientist, and challenges you to build a dinosaur themed amusement park.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences.  Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs.  While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping.\r\n\r\nYou have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths.\r\n\r\nYou can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie.  You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important objects is the Ranger Station.  With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters.  If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart.  If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.\r\n\r\nIn order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed.  The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be.  Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.\r\n\r\nThe different dino's require different resources.  Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows.  Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.\r\n\r\nThe game includes multiple camera angles.  You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter \"visitor\" cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.",

      "description": "Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. \n\nBurnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost \"burnout\" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!\n\nBurnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  \n\nAlong with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.\n\nTraining and 2 player racing modes are also included.",

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.\n\nAs the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.\n\nAs was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

Niobe is a master combatant, capable of beating up everyone in her way.  She is an excellent pilot, both in the real world and in the Matrix. Ghost is very adept at firearms, and his marksmanship is a mastery.  Both characters are very athletic, and throughout the game the player will have to walk, run, jump, strafe, peek, run on walls, climb ladders and pipes, and fight various enemies.\n\nAvailable weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun and grenades.  Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws and grabs to kicks and chokes. Throughout the game,the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.\n\nThe game was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>.

And if you have a car that can race the distance, there's money involved too.\r\n\r\nThis is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities.\r\n\r\nEach race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first.\r\n\r\nEach race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You'll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.",

It features 40 Blitz and Checkpoint races, a career mode titled \"Work Undercover\" which spans 54 varied missions (from racing to driving a pizza car to taking control of an armored bank truck), and a complete online mode that allows you to challenge players over Xbox Live.\n\nThere are two cities to choose from, both modeled after their real counterpart; Paris and Washington D.C.  Paris is the more open ended city, great for beginners, while Washington features lots of narrow streets, sharp and hairpin turns, and various other distractions.\n\nThere are over thirty licensed vehicles to choose from, from a Lotus Esprit Turbo to a real-life garbage truck.  Each vehicle has it's own different characteristics, including speed, handling and acceleration.\n\nOver Xbox Live, you can compete in a variety of games:\n\nCapture The Gold -- Similar to Capture The Flag.<br>\nHunter -- Two players are cops, while the rest are normal vehicles.  When a cop rams you, you become a cop.  The last person left to be pulled over is the winner.<br>\nTag -- Same thing as the childhood game.  One car is \"it\", while the others have to avoid him.\n\n<i>Midtown Madness 3</i> supports voice, and allows you to download various content.",

      "description": "Alan Bradley once helped a computer genius named Kevin Flynn to defeat an evil artificial intelligence with the help of a security program called Tron. Twenty years later, Bradley has reached a new high point in his career: he succeeded in digitizing a human being into the computer and stored the secret of this technique in the Ma3a program. However, the powerful Future Control Industries (fCon) has gained access to this groundbreaking invention, and digitized hackers with the intention of dominating the computer network from within. Alan Bradley is kidnapped, and his son Jet, a computer game programmer, enters the world inside the computer, searching for answers.\n\n<i>TRON 2.0</i> is based on the events of the CG rendered 1982 film TRON, and has been conceived as a sequel to it. The game is a first-person shooter with light role-playing elements. As Jet Bradley, the player must battle digital opponents using guns, rods, grenades, missiles, and the iconic TRON disc. The named of locations and opponents resemble those of programs and other computer-related terms, sometimes with a humorous intention. Using most weapons, as well as acquiring (\"downloading\") various kinds of items depletes the player character's energy bar. Energy and health can be replenished at special terminals or gained in small amounts by defeating enemies. \n\nThe RPG elements appear in form of special items that can be collected and leveling up the player character, allowing the player to upgrade his parameters. The protagonist's level (\"version\") increases when a sufficient amount of so-called \"build notes\" has been collected. The player is free to increase any of the protagonist's five main attributes when leveling up. In addition, various \"sub-routines\" belonging to three classes - combat, defense, and utility - can be found and equipped. These may grant the main character special abilities, new weapons, or combat modifications. Each sub-routine can also be upgraded.\n\nPlayers can race against each other in multiplayer light cycle races, designed by Syd Mead, the film\u2019s concept and original light cycle designer. The game has unusual visuals, representing the inside of a computer program (stylized after the movie). It includes the voice acting of many actors and actresses who were part of the original movie cast.",

      "description": "While the title of this game boasts the ESPN license, this is actually the next game in Sega's NFL 2K series.\r\n\r\nESPN NFL Football has many gameplay modes that include quick game, franchise, season, tournament, practice, first-person football, and online play. The most extensive mode in the game is the franchise mode. This mode allows you to play one season after another and comes complete with a draft and off-season player dealings, like signing and releasing players, governed by the real rules of the NFL, where trade deadlines and salary caps are standard.\r\n\r\nAnother new feature in ESPN NFL Football is a virtual apartment called 'The Crib.' The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game's menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.\r\n\r\nAnother feature added to this game is first-person football.  This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it's like playing on the field.\r\n\r\nChris Berman again adds ESPN style commentary for the audio track.",

      "description": "<b>Dino Crisis 3</b> is the third game in the <i>Dino Crisis</i> series, and this time, it's futuristic.\n\nThe year is 2548.  The colonist spaceship Ozymandias, which disappeared over 300 years ago, suddenly reappears, with no warning or reason to it's disappearance.  Attempting to contact the ship results in nothing.  The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate.  Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant.  Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact.  What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.\n\nAs Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.\n\nDuring your search, you'll have to battle a number of various dinosaurs, from Raptors to the terrible Tyrannosauras Rex.  Luckily, you have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from standard firearms and shotguns to sophisticated laser and beam-guided rifles.  You may also find and use Wasps; little robotic bee-shaped critters that can attack enemies or open doors and other devices.\n\nTo aid you, you are equipped with a jetpack that you can use at any time to hover or speed through areas.  It may also be used when in a tense firefight, taking the battle to the air.  Many dodging and evading techniques are possible with the use of the jetpack.\n\nLike the second game, <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,6/gameId,3625/\">Dino Crisis 2</a>, you are awarded points for every dinosaur you kill.  Kill some in rapid succession, you'll earn more points and double them as well.  With enough points, you can buy new weapons, ammo, and health items at various terminal stations scattered throughout the ship.\n\nWith the aid of three of your best crew, find the survivors, figure out what the hell happened, and most importantly, get off the ship before you become dino dinner.",

There are sixty challenges in all.\n\nWhen racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races.  Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember.  They'll try to get back at you in a future race.  Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you.  Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.\n\nLike the Football Camp mode in <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,13/gameId,10021/\">Madden NFL 2004</a>, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.\n\nWith the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.\n\nThere are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.\n\nAs in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.\n\nTune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.",

This time the player is in the vehicle of their choice.\n\nWhile the game features improved graphics over the older titles in the series the biggest improvement is the handling in the game, which is now based on real-world physics. Where the previous titles' handling of the cars made use of one pivot point, the new physics engine has four pivot points, each wheel interacting independently of the others. \n\nThere are four championships modes: 2WD, 4WD, Group B and Expert. 2WD is for beginners. 4WD is the next step up, offering an intermediate challenge. Group B features cars from the '80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting. \n\nThere are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece.

      "description": "<i>Robocop</i> places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug \"Brain Drain,\" and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. \n\nRobocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.\n\nObjectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop's ethics and \"prime directives.\"",

      "description": "A complete remake of the classic 1986 title <i>Defender of the Crown</i> (not to be confused with the \"Remastered\" Windows version released in 2002), in <i>Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown</i> the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.\n\nSeveral gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.\n\nAs with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:\n\n<li>The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood's eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin's trustworthy  bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.\n<li>If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee  by launching direct attacks on each lane.\n<li>Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents' own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin's imprisonment.\n<li>Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.\n<li>Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.\n<li>Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.",

Perform power slides, 360\u00b0 turns, drive on two wheels or stay in the slipstream of your opponents to build up a stash. With those points, you can unlock new venues and faster race monsters, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Porsche GT2, BMW Z4, Pontiac GTO, Mini Cooper S and many others.\n\nThe game can be played both over System Link as Xbox Live. You can race friends online or download ghosts of the fastest drivers all around the world to improve your own skills.\n\nEach city has its own soundtrack, but you can create and store your own playlists as well.\n",

      "description": "<i>XIII</i> is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum's book <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. The hero knows almost nothing except that he must be important, since everyone is trying to kill him. Gradually uncovering the mystery, the hero, learns more about his secret agent past and his curious name: XIII.\n\nThe player unravels clues, trying to solve a conspiracy set in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions: for example, head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, the game has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than fifteen weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and plenty of enemies in levels spread all over the world. During the game, the player can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.",

      "description": "Twenty years have passed after the events described in Deus Ex. The actions of JC Denton have eventually led to a period of economic depression, known as \"The Collapse\". The world is on the brink of chaos after the dismantling of the mighty biotech corporations, and multiple religious and political groups lust after power. \n\nThe city of Chicago is destroyed in a devastating energy blast by unknown terrorists. Two trainees of the Tarsus Academy, Alex D and Billie Adams, are evacuated to another Tarsus-controlled facility in Seattle. Shortly thereafter the facility is attacked by members of a religious organization called the Order. Billie admits that she has been collaborating with them, implying that Tarsus may be involved in a conspiracy. It is now up to Alex to find his or her place in the new world, and ultimately shape its fate.\n\n<i>Deus Ex: Invisible War</i> is a first-person shooter that retains many gameplay elements of its predecessor, such as conversations with characters, inventory management, exploration, and mixing various gameplay styles during missions. As in the original game, the style of play helps shape the game as it progresses, from how characters interact with the protagonist to the types of situations encountered. Each potential conflict can be resolved in a number of ways, through peaceful means or through violence, using stealth or a show of force. Hacking computer terminals and unlocking doors with special tools are prominently featured.\n\nWeapons can be modified in a variety of ways, e.g. increasing their rate of fire, silencing the shots, allowing the weapon to shoot through glass, etc. Characters can once again outfit their bodies with an array of biotech parts, some of which include the ability to see through walls, disappear from radar, regenerate from critical hits, or jump forty feet in the air. Unlike the previous installment, there are no true role-playing elements in the game. The player must search for biotech canisters to install and upgrade biomods; however, no experience points are awarded for either completing missions or dealing with enemies. Inventory management has been simplified as well.\n\nThe sequel places more emphasis on decisions and different approaches to missions. From the beginning of the game the player has the freedom of performing missions for organizations and people of his or her choice. Like in the first game, several endings can be reached depending on the player's decisions. ",

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

      "description": "In the future, on the planet Allium, the situation has become desperate. This world has suffered from global warming, causing the polar ice caps to melt. The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire population  must survive and compete over these islands.\n\nCurrently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader operator who has been conscripted because of his piloting skills.\n\n<em>Battle Engine Aquila</em> is a mechanized shooter taking place in a larger battlefield. The player plays only a single, yet important, role in a larger war effort. A large part of the gameplay consists of supporting and being supported by the allied forces. Players will have to fight naval, air, and ground forces in both modes of their battle engine.",

Aided by a blind seer and his thieving friends - a robot and a mole - Roman decides to intercept the book and banish the king.\n\nThe game is a variation of the run-and-gun third-person shooter. Created by Planet Moon, it has the same humour and similar gameplay elements as Giants: Citizen Kabuto. \n\nThe game has several unusual characters and weapons.  Included is the shark gun, a device that literally shoots a shark at your enemies.  There is a corkscrew device that burrows in to the ground and inverts gravity. You hang on to the device while your enemies fly into the sky and fall hard back to the ground.",

In this game, the player controls one of 13 American Four By Fours through Hawaii, Moab, or Yosemite to be crowned King of The Off-Road. The player can race in a single, arcade race, take a complete free ride, or race in career mode. There are three kinds of racing to master: Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble.\n\nCircuit Races are exactly as they sound. The player howls around a course through checkpoints before time runs out at least twice.\n\nBlitz Races are considerably shorter than Circuit Races. The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B.\n\nIn Scramble Races the player roars around an area \"collecting\" checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible. These are the shortest races in the game.\n\nThis game can be played by two players.",

Race 165 cars from the 50s to the concepts either in the classic GT 2002 mode or against human players on Xbox Live. \n\nIn GT 2002 mode, the player must work their way up the hill by first buying a cheaper car and winning cash or prize cars in order to acquire better vehicles. <i>SEGA GT Online</i> adds new parts and new cars to the shop, and allows the limited slip differential to be modified. Prize money and prices have been modified as well, and new tracks, including a facsimile of Laguna Seca, reverse tracks, and races set in the morning, evening, and night, have been added to the returning races.\n\nThe player can jump right in the action by selecting a car, from a Chevelle to a Fiat, then a track location, from an American desert to a European village. In addition to the returning Chronicles mode there is also now a Gathering mode with 30 check point, license test, and racing line challenges. As with Chronicles each completed challenge unlocks a car for purchase in GT 2002 mode.\n\nOnline, players could participate in races with other human players, or trade parts with them. As Xbox Live has been shut down this mode is no longer accessible.",

      "description": "Based on the TV show, this game takes various shows and lets you make the vehicle that was made on the shows.  For those who do not know the TV show, it works like this...\r\n\r\nJesse and his team are to build a creation that will do a certain task within 7 days and by spending under $3000 and the vehicle must look stock when completed.\r\n\r\nSo this game gives you the task of building a vehicle that does something such as drive through a swamp by floating on the water and using a large fan to make you move.\r\n\r\nIn day one, you must design the vehicle.  In the early scenarios, you only have one pre-made design to choose from.  In later scenarios, you can choose from three pre-made designs.\r\n\r\nDays two through six are devoted to constructing the vehicle.  You can buy various parts for the vehicle, but most parts will need to be fabricated.  To do this, you will need to purchase raw materials such as sheets of metal or metal rods and assign the task of making something like a roll cage to one of the team members.  They will make the item within a certain period of time while you handle other things. \r\n\r\nThings you need to do include removing parts from the vehicle or attaching parts to the vehicle as needed, and welding items to the vehicle or cutting items off the vehicle.  Every weld and cut is already set up for you and you just follow the line indicated.  Bolts are unscrewed or screwed on as needed.\r\n\r\nBy day seven, your vehicle will have to have been completed, or you will need to try again.  Day seven is used only to update the look of your vehicle.  This includes adding certain custom parts such as gold plated rims, painting the vehicle, and applying decals.\r\n\r\nOnce you are ready, you will take your vehicle to test it out and see if it works.  If you made it to day seven without being required to start over, your vehicle will work.  This is really just a test where you must complete a track in a certain amount of time.  For example, in one mission, you will have to make it around a snow-covered track in your upgraded car that has snowmobile tracks added to help with tracking within a certain amount of time.  You get as many tries as you need to complete this.  Once done, you can move on to the next mission.\r\n\r\nThe challenges of this game are to stay under the $3000 when buying/selling parts and to complete the track at the end.",

It has ideas borrowed from the book <i>Bravo Two Zero</i> and other real missions from the war. \n\nMissions are performed behind enemy lines and have specific objectives (infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, assassinate an opposing general, ...). Team members can be sent orders (attack, retreat, follow, stay, ...) or controlled individually. On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper.  Each soldier has different skills which improve as they kill more enemies and gain experience. This results in them doing a better or faster job (Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase). In some missions, the player drives tanks or jeeps around while other squad members man the guns on the vehicle. At the end of each mission, the soldiers can be awarded medals for their bravery\n\nThe game also features up to four player co-op, each player controlling a soldier in the squad.",

Unexpectedly, an entire race of creatures, known as the T'lan, was found dwelling there, guided by a mysterious being called Nexus. The humans built a research facility near the underground complex, called Site Zero, and sent soldiers to protect the researchers and ensure that the fragile peace between humans and T'lan will last. As Derrick Cole awakens in a recovery facility near Site Zero, he fails to remember anything from his past. Apparently, he was injected T'langen, a fluid that was taken from the T'lan, which has unexpected effects on human organism. As the war between the humans and the T'lan begins, Derrick must first of all find a way to escape, with both sides being hostile to him, unaware of the role he will play in the future of both races.\n\n<i>Breakdown</i> is a first-person action game. Though Derrick can use firearms, it is not entirely a FPS; much of the game's combat relies on melee moves and combos that Derrick learns, turning the game into a \"first-person fighter\". An unusual feature of the game is the completely physical interaction with the environment, which strives to be realistic. In order to force Derrick to pick up ammo, operate an object, eat food to restore health, etc., the player has to physically move the controller, imitating corresponding real-life movements.",

      "description": "Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series.  Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.\n\nMissions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the <i>Galactica</i>. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and <i>Galactica</i>'s war room.  Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.\n\nPlayers control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full.  Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.\n\nMissiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu.  Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.  This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.\n\nThough it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the <i>Galactica</i> itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.",

However, as he became disillusioned with the gang's murderous ways and distanced himself from it, he turned into a liability to the criminals. The gang's leader shot him and left him for dead; barely surviving, El Tejon was imprisoned by the authorities. In the prison, he meets a member of a revolutionary movement, and becomes determined to regain his freedom and exact revenge upon those who betrayed him.\n\n<i>Dead Man's Hand</i> is a first-person 3D shooter set in the Wild West. The protagonist is armed with a fairly standard arsenal, which includes pistols, rifles, shotguns, TNT, bombs, etc. The game rewards the player for precise shooting and creative ways of killing enemies (e.g. by shooting a rock that drops on them): as the player practices these activities, the protagonist's \"trick meter\" is being gradually refilled. A full trick meter allows secondary shooting mode, unique for each weapon. Between levels the player can compete in poker to increase the protagonist's health and ammunition.",

Your character is a computer generated version of Steve McQueen as are all the other actors for their characters.\n\nThe game play involves sneaking about the prison camp and interacting with other prisoners to obtain various items to aid you in your escape. The physics are identical to Conflict: Desert Storm. The game play shifts to all-out combat as well as the infamous motorbike chase.",

The whole game takes place in \"flashbacks\", where 47 is reminiscing about past missions, some of which were previously seen in Hitman: Codename 47, the first game from the <i>Hitman</i> series.\n\nGameplay in <i>Hitman: Contracts</i> is similar to the previous installments. Your job will be to complete several missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from \"Mass Murderer\" up to the coveted \"Silent Assassin\". If you manage to complete a mission with a \"Silent Assassin\" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons.

      "description": "Master Thief Garrett is contacted by the Keeper Artemus, who wants him to steal two valuable artifacts. Meanwhile, Garrett learns that the coming of a Dark Age had been prophesied long ago. Gaining access to the Keeper Prophecies, Garrett learns that an ancient book known as the Compendium of Reproach contains more information about the prophecy. As Garrett is trying to solve the mystery, it becomes more and more clear to him that there is a traitor in the order of the Keepers.\n\n<i>Thief: Deadly Shadows</i> is the third installment in the <i>Thief</i> series. The game follows the same design philosophy and gameplay structure that distinguished its predecessors. As before, stealth is the key to successful completion of missions. Avoiding confrontation with the guards, Garrett has to make his way through the levels towards the objective. Shadows and sounds play a large role, as guards will react to suspicious noises, and studying their patrolling routines is essential.\n\nA few gameplay elements have been slightly altered. Garrett can no longer swim, but is able to use climbing gloves that attach him to the walls. He can also flatten himself against walls while standing; if in shadow, he remains completely unnoticeable that way. The player can see Garrett's limbs even if he is viewed from first-person perspective, allowing more precise movements. Switching to third-person view is also possible.\n\nThe most significant gameplay change is the non-linear exploration of the City, which has been added to the largely linear missions. In order to access the next mission, Garrett has to explore the City. On his way, he can overhear conversations, steal valuables, avoid or knock out the guards, and even accept secondary missions, which will influence his reputation with some of its factions.",
