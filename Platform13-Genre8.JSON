      "description": "Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.\n\n<i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.\n\nOnly two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.\n\nYour life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.\n\nOne of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.\n\n<i>Halo</i> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.",

You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race.  All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.\n\nThe game encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter.  You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened. Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small \"grunt\" type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you.  Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.\n\nIn a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times.  The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title.  When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked, and running is often the only option. You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.",

Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.\n\nLike its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).\n\nThe Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Beginning where Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones left off, you must take control of either Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu or Obi-Wan Kenobi and lead the Republic Army against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nThe Clone Wars picks up with Mace Windu escorting the Jedi ambush to the Geonosis arena, which leads to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars.  After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var.  After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var.  They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon.  Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!\n\nThe Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.  Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles.  You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon.  Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.",

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the <i>Robotech</i> cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game.\n\nAs the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.",

The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.",

      "description": "<em>Steel Battalion</em> is a 'mech game in which the player takes control of mechanized tanks, known as \"VT\"s (or Vertical Tanks), using a forty button controller with footpedals.\n\nNot too far in the future, military unrest is rampant throughout the world, and the player has just recently been promoted. As the pilot of a state-of-the-art mech known as a Vertical Tank, the player must take charge of keeping the peace. Players must master the integrated controller to clear their way to victory.\n\n<em>SB</em> comes packaged with a forty button controller, consisting of three separate boards, and a footpedal. On the controller there are buttons that activate commands such as switching radio frequencies, activating the windshield wipers, changing radar scanners, switching weapons, firing weapons, locking abilities, defense mechanisms, and more. The controller has two joysticks, one which moves the 'mech forward and backward, and one that allows the player to move and aim. The footpedal controls speed and braking, independent of the stick, and a third pedal controls slide-strafe.\n\nAn interesting feature is that of the eject button. Encased in clear plastic, similar to an \"abort\" button at a military installation, this command can save the player's life. As the player nears death they must quickly flip the lid and push the button, otherwise they die, and death in the game is forever, as the pilot data is erased from the hard drive/memory unit, forcing players to start over.\n\nTo defeat enemy mechs the player is equipped with a variety of high-tech weapons, such as Plasma Torches, Twin Pod Rocket Launchers, and a 270mm Rifle Cannon.\n\nThere are a total of fifteen 'mechs to pilot, and ten missions to accomplish.",

      "description": "Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the <i>Atlantis</i>, patrol this dangerous sector of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.\n\nThe first-person shooter <i>Unreal II</i>, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the Skaarj from <i>Unreal</i> and the Liandri Corporation from <i>Unreal Tournament</i> being major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions, taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge starship.\n\nThe weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two different firing modes.\n\nMissions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.\n\nThe story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments. Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the <i>Atlantis</i> and chat with his crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the main plot.",

Ghost is very adept at firearms, and his marksmanship is a mastery.  Both characters are very athletic, and throughout the game the player will have to walk, run, jump, strafe, peek, run on walls, climb ladders and pipes, and fight various enemies.\n\nAvailable weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun and grenades.  Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws and grabs to kicks and chokes. Throughout the game,the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.\n\nThe game was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>.

      "description": "Four thousand years before the events depicted in the Star Wars movies, the political and ideological situation is not much different from what we have seen in the prequel trilogy: the Republic and the Jedi Order are fighting against two powerful Sith lords, Darth Revan and his apprentice, Darth Malak. It is said that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.\n\n<i>Knights of the Old Republic</i> is a role-playing game that uses the <i>Star Wars D20</i> rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar \"real-time with pause\" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as opposed to six in <i>Baldur's Gate</i>). Several characters join the party and can be switched at the player's will.\n\nEventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others. The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc. \n\nThroughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees,  the desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.",

The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs.\r\n\r\nUpgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.",

      "description": "Alan Bradley once helped a computer genius named Kevin Flynn to defeat an evil artificial intelligence with the help of a security program called Tron. Twenty years later, Bradley has reached a new high point in his career: he succeeded in digitizing a human being into the computer and stored the secret of this technique in the Ma3a program. However, the powerful Future Control Industries (fCon) has gained access to this groundbreaking invention, and digitized hackers with the intention of dominating the computer network from within. Alan Bradley is kidnapped, and his son Jet, a computer game programmer, enters the world inside the computer, searching for answers.\n\n<i>TRON 2.0</i> is based on the events of the CG rendered 1982 film TRON, and has been conceived as a sequel to it. The game is a first-person shooter with light role-playing elements. As Jet Bradley, the player must battle digital opponents using guns, rods, grenades, missiles, and the iconic TRON disc. The named of locations and opponents resemble those of programs and other computer-related terms, sometimes with a humorous intention. Using most weapons, as well as acquiring (\"downloading\") various kinds of items depletes the player character's energy bar. Energy and health can be replenished at special terminals or gained in small amounts by defeating enemies. \n\nThe RPG elements appear in form of special items that can be collected and leveling up the player character, allowing the player to upgrade his parameters. The protagonist's level (\"version\") increases when a sufficient amount of so-called \"build notes\" has been collected. The player is free to increase any of the protagonist's five main attributes when leveling up. In addition, various \"sub-routines\" belonging to three classes - combat, defense, and utility - can be found and equipped. These may grant the main character special abilities, new weapons, or combat modifications. Each sub-routine can also be upgraded.\n\nPlayers can race against each other in multiplayer light cycle races, designed by Syd Mead, the film\u2019s concept and original light cycle designer. The game has unusual visuals, representing the inside of a computer program (stylized after the movie). It includes the voice acting of many actors and actresses who were part of the original movie cast.",

      "description": "<b>Dino Crisis 3</b> is the third game in the <i>Dino Crisis</i> series, and this time, it's futuristic.\n\nThe year is 2548.  The colonist spaceship Ozymandias, which disappeared over 300 years ago, suddenly reappears, with no warning or reason to it's disappearance.  Attempting to contact the ship results in nothing.  The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate.  Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant.  Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact.  What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.\n\nAs Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.\n\nDuring your search, you'll have to battle a number of various dinosaurs, from Raptors to the terrible Tyrannosauras Rex.  Luckily, you have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from standard firearms and shotguns to sophisticated laser and beam-guided rifles.  You may also find and use Wasps; little robotic bee-shaped critters that can attack enemies or open doors and other devices.\n\nTo aid you, you are equipped with a jetpack that you can use at any time to hover or speed through areas.  It may also be used when in a tense firefight, taking the battle to the air.  Many dodging and evading techniques are possible with the use of the jetpack.\n\nLike the second game, <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,6/gameId,3625/\">Dino Crisis 2</a>, you are awarded points for every dinosaur you kill.  Kill some in rapid succession, you'll earn more points and double them as well.  With enough points, you can buy new weapons, ammo, and health items at various terminal stations scattered throughout the ship.\n\nWith the aid of three of your best crew, find the survivors, figure out what the hell happened, and most importantly, get off the ship before you become dino dinner.",

      "description": "<i>Robocop</i> places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug \"Brain Drain,\" and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. \n\nRobocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.\n\nObjectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop's ethics and \"prime directives.\"",

Death</i>. Players will battle vampires, the undead, and even a cadre of Dark Judges as they try to maintain some semblance of order in a world gone wild. In keeping with the spirit of the comic, some perpetrators of lesser crimes need to be arrested while others must be taken out with extreme prejudice. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to confront the evil Judge Death, who has taken it upon himself to cause as much mayhem and destruction to the beleaguered city as possible.

      "description": "Twenty years have passed after the events described in Deus Ex. The actions of JC Denton have eventually led to a period of economic depression, known as \"The Collapse\". The world is on the brink of chaos after the dismantling of the mighty biotech corporations, and multiple religious and political groups lust after power. \n\nThe city of Chicago is destroyed in a devastating energy blast by unknown terrorists. Two trainees of the Tarsus Academy, Alex D and Billie Adams, are evacuated to another Tarsus-controlled facility in Seattle. Shortly thereafter the facility is attacked by members of a religious organization called the Order. Billie admits that she has been collaborating with them, implying that Tarsus may be involved in a conspiracy. It is now up to Alex to find his or her place in the new world, and ultimately shape its fate.\n\n<i>Deus Ex: Invisible War</i> is a first-person shooter that retains many gameplay elements of its predecessor, such as conversations with characters, inventory management, exploration, and mixing various gameplay styles during missions. As in the original game, the style of play helps shape the game as it progresses, from how characters interact with the protagonist to the types of situations encountered. Each potential conflict can be resolved in a number of ways, through peaceful means or through violence, using stealth or a show of force. Hacking computer terminals and unlocking doors with special tools are prominently featured.\n\nWeapons can be modified in a variety of ways, e.g. increasing their rate of fire, silencing the shots, allowing the weapon to shoot through glass, etc. Characters can once again outfit their bodies with an array of biotech parts, some of which include the ability to see through walls, disappear from radar, regenerate from critical hits, or jump forty feet in the air. Unlike the previous installment, there are no true role-playing elements in the game. The player must search for biotech canisters to install and upgrade biomods; however, no experience points are awarded for either completing missions or dealing with enemies. Inventory management has been simplified as well.\n\nThe sequel places more emphasis on decisions and different approaches to missions. From the beginning of the game the player has the freedom of performing missions for organizations and people of his or her choice. Like in the first game, several endings can be reached depending on the player's decisions. ",

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\n<i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Beside hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). ",

The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire population  must survive and compete over these islands.\n\nCurrently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader operator who has been conscripted because of his piloting skills.\n\n<em>Battle Engine Aquila</em> is a mechanized shooter taking place in a larger battlefield. The player plays only a single, yet important, role in a larger war effort. A large part of the gameplay consists of supporting and being supported by the allied forces. Players will have to fight naval, air, and ground forces in both modes of their battle engine.",

Aided by a blind seer and his thieving friends - a robot and a mole - Roman decides to intercept the book and banish the king.\n\nThe game is a variation of the run-and-gun third-person shooter. Created by Planet Moon, it has the same humour and similar gameplay elements as Giants: Citizen Kabuto. \n\nThe game has several unusual characters and weapons.  Included is the shark gun, a device that literally shoots a shark at your enemies.  There is a corkscrew device that burrows in to the ground and inverts gravity. You hang on to the device while your enemies fly into the sky and fall hard back to the ground.",

Unexpectedly, an entire race of creatures, known as the T'lan, was found dwelling there, guided by a mysterious being called Nexus. The humans built a research facility near the underground complex, called Site Zero, and sent soldiers to protect the researchers and ensure that the fragile peace between humans and T'lan will last. As Derrick Cole awakens in a recovery facility near Site Zero, he fails to remember anything from his past. Apparently, he was injected T'langen, a fluid that was taken from the T'lan, which has unexpected effects on human organism. As the war between the humans and the T'lan begins, Derrick must first of all find a way to escape, with both sides being hostile to him, unaware of the role he will play in the future of both races.\n\n<i>Breakdown</i> is a first-person action game. Though Derrick can use firearms, it is not entirely a FPS; much of the game's combat relies on melee moves and combos that Derrick learns, turning the game into a \"first-person fighter\". An unusual feature of the game is the completely physical interaction with the environment, which strives to be realistic. In order to force Derrick to pick up ammo, operate an object, eat food to restore health, etc., the player has to physically move the controller, imitating corresponding real-life movements.",

      "description": "Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series.  Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.\n\nMissions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the <i>Galactica</i>. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and <i>Galactica</i>'s war room.  Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.\n\nPlayers control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full.  Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.\n\nMissiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu.  Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.  This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.\n\nThough it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.  The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the <i>Galactica</i> itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.",

When fighting an opponent hand-to-hand there are multiple punch and kick combinations that can be used, these have greater effect on the opponent rendering them senseless quicker. Unconscious opponents can be picked up and then either hit some more or thrown. \n\nAround the levels there are power-ups to collect such as health and cash, the health is used immediately to restore the player's character while the cash is used on the black market, accessed via the pause menu, to purchase new combat manoeuvres; permanent upgrades; temporary upgrades or weapons.\n",

As a new member(s) to the Brotherhood, you'll soon find yourself separated from your comrades and forced to contend with a variety of missions and challenges alone. Radscorpions, Super-Mutants and Deathclaws are all in the Brotherhood's way, and bringing an end to their tyranny will certainly make the wasteland a safer place.\n\n<i>Brotherhood of Steel</i> is an action game set in the <i>Fallout</i> universe. The Brotherhood members are well armed and carry full clips of ammo (which does run out). New weapons of various nature can be found and equipped to bring new tactics. Shooting down enemies earns experience points and these points are used to improve the attributes of various individual skills. Additionally, your character will have to content with finding keys and other objects, protecting NPCs and jumping over bottomless pits.",

      "description": "<i>Alter Echo</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on close quarters combat. It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevio has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance.\n\nLuckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevo gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevio's life energy, new moves or better weapons.\n\nBesides combat, the game features basic switch puzzles and rhythm-based mini games. Most notable is the Time Dilation Mode, which can be activated near enemies - then the mini game begins and, if successful ended, launches an especially powerful attack.",

You are the most wanted man in the known universe, and you have just been captured and arrested.  You are being transported to Butcher Bay, a triple-maximum-security prison, the deadliest prison ever built.  No one has ever escaped, and those who tried have been killed.  Will you be the first?\n\nAs Riddick, you must find your way out of the prison and to safety.  You begin in a cell, and soon, hell breaks out.  You are left with nothing to defend yourself, so you must find a machine which will allow you to use guards weapons, otherwise you will be shocked, as they are DNA protected.\n\nThroughout your adventure, you will explore the prison complex, caverns, mines, the triple-security area, and even the palace area, where all of the administration is housed.\n\nTo help you escape, you will have access to a small but deadly arsenal of weapons, such as a pistol and machine gun.  There are a number of melee weapons available too, like a wrench or shiv (shard of glass).\n\nYou will have to take on several different enemies, from guards to prisoners to robotics to mutated humans, also called 'dwellers' who lives deep below under the prison.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874/\">Vin Diesel</a> voices Riddick.  The game is a prequel to the 1999 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/\">Pitch Black</a>, which first introduced Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick, the anti-hero.",

      "description": "<i>Psi-Ops</i> is an action game with a twist: no longer do you have to rely solely on big weapons and explosions to progress through it - you also have the aid of psychic powers to take down army after army of enemy soldiers.\n\nIn the game you take the role of Nick Scryer, a secret agent who had his face reconstructed and mind wiped clean in order to infiltrate a growing psychic organization calling itself The Movement. Nick, however, is captured, but manages to free himself and continue his mission to stop The Movement, regaining his psychic abilities along the way.\n\nThe game mixes regular weapons with the weapons of the mind. You'll have access to a series of mind powers, such as Telekinesis (the ability to fling object and soldiers around), Pyrokineses (the ability to set things on fire), Mind Drain (for draining Psi power out of foes' minds) and Remote Viewing (leaving your body behind and exploring the level).",

Each game is presented in their entirety, with an optional \"Navi Mode\" to change the user interface to closer match Mega Man 8.

      "description": "This game is the successor to Ricochet Xtreme. It's a Breakout variant, so you have your little ship (the paddle) at the bottom of the playfield, which initially shoots a ball, and then reflect it back into the playfield. Your mission is to destroy all bricks in the game. Once all are removed, you proceed to the next level.\n\nUnique (at least I didn't saw it elsewhere) about the bricks is, that there are not only fixed and straight moving bricks, but there is also \"vibration\" in some levels. In example in the Underwater World, bricks will swing in complex patterns, both up/down or left/right, some of them even \"fly\" more chaotic.\n\nThe game offers 4 different main worlds (like Underwater, Volcano, or an Alien world) with 4 sub-worlds each. Each of the sub-worlds have 10 levels, so you can play 160 different levels. There are 4 different difficulty settings available.\n\nOn your journey through the game, you encounter lots of usual Power-Ups, like Small/Big Ball, Slow/Fast Ball, Catcher (to prevent loosing the ball), Multiball, 8-Ball, Laser equipped paddle, the all destroying ball (here it's the corrosive ball). But there also Power-Ups to create new balls (not through multiplying), Power-Ups that change the type of other bricks. Or how about a laser firing ball? But there are much more things in the game.",

      "description": "The third game of the DOOM series (now in full 3D) takes gamers through the depths of Hell, where technology and demons meet. But this time round, the game is more focused on horror elements than previous games in series.\n\n<i>Doom 3</i> is set in the year 2145, on Mars. You start as an unnamed marine soldier sent to the Red Planet, where a corporation named The Union Aerospace Corporation makes secret experiments based on ancient aliens' technology. People around the base are on the edge, & something is not right. You receive your first simple mission and when you depart, the game really kicks off.\n\nThis third major release of the <i>Doom</i> series is especially based on single player experience. As in most First Person Shooter games, you aim, you shoot, & you run... Enemies are zombified humans from the base or daemons straight from Hell. Doom 3 is much darker visually than previous games - you can use a flashlight in dark corridors, but you must choose between various weapons and the flashlight (the marine can't use them both in same time.)\n\nThe game has multiplayer with four game modes for four players.\n\n",

In the past, he worked with a group of soldiers known as WinterICE, attempting to locate an elderly scientist who has been conducting research into psychic powers. In the present, John attempts to piece together what he remembers and locate members of WinterICE in the hope that he can clear his name, work out what actually happened, and discover how he came to have psychic powers himself.\n\n<i>Second Sight</i> is a 3D shooter with stealth elements. The player mostly controls John from a third-person perspective, though it is possible to switch to first-person view under certain circumstances. During the course of the game the player gets to use telekinesis, healing, charm, projection and possession powers and two types of psychic attack, plus a variety of weapons. Most situations can be tackled with stealth, mindless violence or psychic powers, or a combination of the three. ",

      "description": " For the first time in gaming history, after countless games depicting various aspects of the rich Star Wars universe (including some we never wanted to see), players have the chance to step into the boots of the average soldier in the wars that raged across the galaxy. Gameplay is based on the successful standards set by Battlefield 1942, but combat in Battlefront is even more massive and heated, vehicles are more predominant and the familiar starships are also included.\r\n\r\n There are three different game modes to play: Historical Campaign (featuring a series of \"historical\" battles from the Star Wars mythos), Conquest (in which players vie for dominance of individual planets) and, of course, Instant Action. The game puts two pairs of factions at war: Republic vs Separatists and Rebel Alliance vs Galactic Empire. Each faction has four standard unit types (soldier, heavy weapons trooper, scout and pilot) plus a fifth, special unit which differs radically for each side. Famous Jedi and Sith are included as NPCs only in selected battles. Finally, the game offers almost all of the vehicles seen in the movies for players to fly, drive or hover and prevail.",

      "description": "In the sequel to Halo, Spartan-117, better known as the Master Chief, has returned to Earth, where he is promptly needed: despite all precautions taken, the Covenant have discovered the location of humanity's homeworld and are launching their attack. For some reason, however, their fleet is much smaller than expected. To solve this mystery, the Chief must return to the stars, learning more about the mysterious Halo rings and their constructors.\n\nMeanwhile, the Covenant Elite who commanded the fleet at the Halo construct is blamed for the destruction of the ring and branded a heretic. The High Prophets grant him another chance, however: he is made the Arbiter, a special operative for the Prophets, ordered to carry out impossible missions. He will be dealing with dissent and rebellion among the Covenant - a conflict where he might find himself to be on the wrong side.\n\nThe player controls both the Chief and the Arbiter in <i>Halo 2</i>, a first-person-shooter in the same style as the first game. Its main gameplay characteristics are the same: only two weapons can be carried at a time (leading to a tactical choice as to which are to be taken), instead of a standard health points system there is the recharging energy shield (leading to an emphasis on finding cover during firefights), AI-controlled teammates will fight along the protagonist, and there are lots of sections involving vehicles.\n\nNew features include the ability to double-wield certain weapons, doubling the firing rate at the expense of accuracy and the ability to execute melee attacks or throw grenades. Part of the weapon arsenal is unchanged from the first game, but there are also some additions. The human projectile weapons are mostly new and include a pistol, shotgun, SMG and battle rifle. Returning are the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher. The Covenant energy-based weapons (still prone to overheating) from Halo all return, and new additions include several heavy hitters like the Brute Shot and Fuel Rod Gun along with the projectile-based Carbine and the Beam Rifle, both useful for sniping. The Energy Sword is a powerful melee weapon, able to kill most enemies with a single strike.\n\nAll vehicles from the original game also return: Warthog jeeps and Scorpion tanks for the Humans, Banshee fliers, Ghost gliders and Wraith tanks for the Covenant. A new addition is the Covenant Spectre, which with its rear-mounted cannon wielded by a dedicated gunner is comparable to the Warthog. A new player ability concerning vehicles is to board them while in use and either kick off the driver and take over, or in the case of heavy tanks, throwing in a grenade.\n\nThe multiplayer component of the game has been greatly expanded. On the Xbox, Xbox Live is now supported in addition to split screen and system link. The campaign can be played by two players in split screen. Competitive game types include Slayer and Team Slayer (standard free-for-all deathmatch), Capture the Flag, Assault (planting a bomb in the enemy base), Territories (controlling sections of a map for a certain amount of time), Oddball (finding a skull on the map and then holding on to it as long as possible) and more. All types have several built-in variants and can also be customized further. Players can choose from Spartan and Covenant Elite skins. The PC version comes with a map editor.",

      "description": "Following the period of instability caused by the events described in Half-Life, an interdimensional organization known as the Combine invades the Earth, defeating the human forces in the Seven Hour War. A Combine Citadel is erected in City 17, a town in Eastern Europe reminiscent of World War II ghettos. Dr. Wallace Breen, a human scientist, rules the city on behalf of his new masters. An energy field prevents humans from procreating, and no new children are born. Earth is turning into a grim, oppressive police state.\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon Freeman, the man who was at the center of the events that took place shortly before the rise of the Combine, awakens from his stasis and is inserted into a train to City 17 by the mysterious G-man. Gordon is soon brought into a resistance group, and makes a seemingly futile attempt to bring down the Combine and liberate the Earth. \n\n<i>Half-Life 2</i> is a linear first-person shooter with light puzzle-solving elements and many setpieces, similar to its predecessor in concept. The player guides Gordon Freeman through the City 17 and the wilderness that surrounds it. On his way, he'll encounter a few friendly characters, but also fight dangerous foes. The game features a realistic physics system: Gordon can pick up objects and toss them freely, and many of the puzzles are physics-based - for example, at one point the player has to weigh down a seesaw with bricks at one end to turn it into a ramp. \n\nGordon's enemies, apart from alien wildlife which found its way to Earth, are mainly Combine forces, which utilize a variety of firearms, gadgets and vehicles. Policemen and foot soldiers work along with helicopters, gunships and gigantic walking machines to hunt him down. To defend himself, Gordon has a range of weapons available: from the iconic crowbar for close-quarter fighting, through pistols and rifles, up to grenades and a rocket launcher. One of the most notable weapons is the gravity gun, with which Gordon can pick up objects, hold them in the gun's anti-gravity field, then hurl them at the enemy with great force. \n\nSetpieces in the game include co-ordinated assaults on enemy bases, fighting gigantic boss enemies, bringing down aircrafts with the rocket launcher, and others. A few levels require the player to navigate buggy-type vehicles. Some of the more exotic stages involve the player summoning an army of antlions to unleash on unsuspecting foes.\n\nIncluded with the game is Counter-Strike: Source, a version of Counter-Strike made with the new Source engine which powers <i>Half-Life 2</i>, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, an online multiplayer game featuring the same physics and weapons as the single player game.",

      "description": "Five years after the events depicted in Knights of the Old Republic, the Sith have become stronger and more determined to rule the Galaxy. The Jedi Order is nearly exterminated. A mysterious ex-Jedi has been exiled from the Order and is traveling alone. This Jedi had served under Darth Revan (when the latter was still on the Light side of the Force) during the Mandalorian Wars, but due to enigmatic circumstances was forced to retire. Now the past is catching up with the Jedi, and soon he or she will have to choose the side to fight on.\n\n<i>The Sith Lords</i> looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, also being based on the <i>Star Wars d20</i> role-playing rule set (which, in its turn, is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons) and having the same combat engine, character development, and a Light and Dark ethical system, which judges the player's decisions and actions and influences story events and characters' responses. Additions to the gameplay include a lightsaber-crafting system, which allows augmenting lightsabers with various items, new Force powers, and the possibility to influence the alignments of the characters in the player-controlled party through conversation choices and other decisions. Most of the exploration and the combat sequences is done using a party of three, including the protagonist and two companions. However, certain parts of the game will force the player to travel alone, or to control a party made exclusively out of companions.\n\nA large part of the military equipment can be upgraded using any workbench that can be found throughout the game world, including one available at all times on the ship that the player uses to travel between planetary systems. Different types of items have more than one piece that can be augmented. For example, the armor has two slots for upgrades (overlay and underlay), while ranged weapons have three (targeting, firing chamber, and power pack), and lightsabers have six. The easiest way to get additional upgrades is to either buy them or loot them, however they can be created as well at a workbench with the right components and enough repair skill. Medical items are a different sort and they can be crafted using lab stations.\n\nAt various moments during the game, the player has the opportunity to play some mini games: a card game called Pazaak, shooting targets using a turret from a first-person view, and swoop racing.",

      "description": "<i>American McGee presents SCRAPLAND</i> is a third-person 3D action game set on an asteroid called Scrapland, a ruined paradise rebuilt by robots, the only inhabitants now. The player controls D-Tritus, a self-constructed young robot that has just arrived Chimera, the main city. The adventure begins when he accepts a job as journalist and strange things start to happen...\n\nThe game is a mix between free-form outdoor levels and indoor levels with combat and puzzle-solving elements. During said indoor levels the player can instantly change his form between 14 robots, all with their own advantages and special abilities. Utilizing those robots is important to solve puzzles or mini games, e.g. only a tiny robot can fit into small spaces and only certain robots are allowed into the areas. However, those disguises can be seen through by certain enemy types. Then it is a good idea to change to a robot with fighting abilities - aiming is basically done automatically by the game.\n\nThe outdoor levels can be freely explored, but there is not much more to do then flying to next mission objective or indoor level. The parts of the space ship can be upgraded individually; better parts are gained during the game and by solving optional missions. The player can have up to nine different space ships and switch between them if needed - a heavy one is better suited for fights while a small one is useful for races.\n\nAdditionally the game features various outdoor areas which can be started outside the campaign and three multiplayer modes.",

After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?\n\n<i>Alien Hominid</i> is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.\n\nTo help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.\n\nThe GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special \"PDA Game\" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.",

      "description": "Psyvariar 2 is another specimen of the recent breed of \"newschool\" arcade shoot'em'ups (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.\n\nAs most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called \"buzzing\" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. \n\nAs in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an  extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.",

As the amount of bricks on top of the screen increases, you need to pop a target number of bricks with matching colours before the rows reach the bottom of the screen. By linking four bricks or more, you create chain reactions. To spice up the gameplay, there are special power-ups such as radial bombs, freeze bombs, column nukes and difficult obstacles such as toxic, steel and stone bricks.\n\nEach of the four playable characters has a <i>supa weapon</i> that destroys all bricks on the screen. It can only be used after charging it. There are two playing modes: <i>Classic</i> with weapon upgrades and 32 levels per character and <i>Survival</i> in which you need to stay alive as long as possible.",

Jump in and let's go for a ride.\n\nThe game adds new gameplay elements to the system used in <i>MechAssault</i>. In the original game, the player was a Mech pilot and nothing else. Here, the player is the only pilot in the game world. This means that the player can now get out of a Mech and drive someone else's Mech. Want to drive a tank or some of the other vehicles? Well, now it is possible. Jump in many of the vehicles and take one for a ride.

      "description": "Set during the events of the movie, <i>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</i>, a secret army of clones has been grown on planet Kamino, designed from the DNA of Jango Fett. These clones  and trained for battle and to fight for the Galactic Republic, trained in specific talents and abilities. One such specialization is Delta Squad, a group of four commandos trained for ground combat, recon work and outfitted with bacta healing implants. Delta squad is composed of four members: RC-1138 (\"Boss\"): the squadron leader bred for tactics, RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"): a computer cracker, RC-1207 (\"Sev\"): a hunter and marksman, and RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"): a demolitions specialist. Delta Squad and the rest of the clone army are deployed to their first battle, on the planet Geonosis.\n\n<i>Star Wars: Republic Commando</i> is a first-person squad-based shooter set in the Star Wars universe with tactical squad gameplay. Players take the roll of Boss, the leader of Delta Squad. Like most first-person shooters, the emphasis in gameplay is on action. Republic soldiers use a standard gun weapon, the \"Blaster\", in order to shoot opponents in front of them. Blasters can be attached to perform three different functions, with individual ammunition: a standard fiting mode, a sniper mode and an anti-armor mode. Players also carry an smaller energy pistol that automatically charges itself. New weapons can be found from a defeated enemy or found lying around on some levels, however only one may be carried at any given time. Some player weapons allow zooming functions for more accurate firing. The player also carries 4 different types of grenades, which are: thermal detonators (basic blast), sonar detectors (limited proximity detection), electrostatic charges  (disables electronics and droids) and flash detonators (blinds foes). All of which can be thrown directly in front of the player. \n\nEach member of delta squad has a personal shield that automatically recharges after a short time and a health bar which can only be replenished by healing bacta. Bacta is found at appropriate dispensers throughout the levels, and additionally each member of the squad carries an emergency bacta device to \"revive\" any member of the squad who falls in battle. Should the player be the one to lose all health, they watch the level from a hazed view and can issue a last order for other squadmates to try and revive them. Should all 4 members of delta squad fall in battle, the game is over.\n\nThe main feature of Republic Commando is the 4-man squad. Using a \"one-touch\" control system, the player gives orders to members of Delta Squad. The first type of command is for setting the squad's attitude: Search and Destroy (move forward), Form Up (stay close), Hold Position, and Recall from any assigned positions. The other type of orders are done by highlighting different positions displayed on the player's HUD and assigning a Delta member to perform the appropriate action. All of these positions are pre-defined in the level, with only a single action being possible. Examples of positions include: Cover for a sniper, barriers which need to be destroyed, turrets that can be mounted and used to attack the enemy, mines which can be disarmed, control panels which can be hacked, etc. Despite the hint of specialization designations and character personalities, any squad member, including the player, can be used to perform any action.\n\nMultiplayer functionality includes regular deathmatches and capture the flag. There is no squad-based commands in multiplayer, though players may be placed on individual \"teams\" to work towards their goal.",

      "description": "<i>LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game</i> allows players to relive the events of the <i>Star Wars</i> prequel movie trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) in LEGO form.  Players take control of over thirty characters to play through key moments from <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. The storyline includes most of the important events in the movies, omitting or adding a few sequences. The presentation of these events, however, is humorous, with all the characters and environments made out of LEGO bricks. Objects would often break apart like physical LEGO bricks, characters have comical expressions, and all dialogue from corresponding events from the movies is replaced by gestures.\n\nThe basic gameplay is action with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements. Players navigate two or more characters through stages, each representing a chapter in a movie. These chapters must be unlocked in a plot-dictated order, eventually completing the entire movie. Characters use different weapons (blasters, lightsabers, crossbows, etc.), and each character type also possesses specific abilities. For example, Jedi can use the force to lift, combine, and destroy objects; robots can unlock encrypted doors; other characters may use a grappling hook to access higher platforms, etc. Some of these abilities overlap (i.e. a problem can be solved in more than one way), though often a specific type of character is required to deal with the situation. In the single-player mode, one player can switch between the available characters; in the co-op mode, two players navigate at least two different characters.\n\nA few levels involve players piloting aircraft, fighting hostile vehicles, overcoming obstacles or destroying targets on the ground. The Free Mode allows players to access previously visited stages with any characters they have unlocked. This may lead to a discovery of previously inaccessible areas. Various collectible items and LEGO studs (which serve as currency) can be gathered during exploration. Characters cannot permanently die in the game; when a character is killed, he or she only loses collected LEGO studs.",

Starting as a subordinate, Sho quickly becomes the leader of a special squadron of soldiers that will use all its power to stop the muton invasion.\n\n<i>Crimson Sea</i> is a mission-based action game set in a distant future. In some cases, you can choose yourself the order in which you want to tackle the missions. Some of the missions have a time limit. Sho will encounter hordes of mutons and battle ferocious muton bosses. He can find and attach various upgrades to his custom weapon that allow new attacks. He also uses \"neo-psyonic powers\", which work pretty much like magic spells. There are slight role-playing elements in the game: it is possible to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, and items in stores, and weapons can gain experience points when continuously used in battles.",

He soon discovers that the crystals he has found can power up a time machine. After having located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil.\n\n<i>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</i> is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also some stealth and vehicle-driving segments.\n\nLike in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters and challenge other players to a head-to-head battle, either with up to four-player split screen or online and LAN play.",

      "description": "At a summer camp for up-and-coming psychics, a young boy with an unusually high level of psychic ability inexplicably shows up. The boy, named Raz, is allowed to stay at the camp until his father comes to pick him up, but his arrival coincides with very strange circumstances. Soon, evidence that someone is psychically tampering with the campers' minds reveals itself, and Raz is the only one who can stop it. Raz must project himself into the psyches of several different people in order to figure out what is going on and who is behind the recent occurrences.\n\n<i>Psychonauts</i> is a 3D platform game with a rather unorthodox style. The characters' inner worlds are the game's levels. Each world reflects the personality of the person whose psyche it represents, often resulting in unique, surreal creations, and influencing the gameplay style. For example, the psyche of a giant lungfish is presented as a large city populated by fish people, in which Raz himself becomes a giant monster who can destroy entire buildings; the psyche of a mental patient is a huge board game, where Raz has to command armies in order to defeat Napoleon, etc.\n\nThere are also many gameplay elements and tasks which are common for all the levels. These include Raz fighting the (not very numerous) regular enemies, defeating level bosses, collecting currency, \"figments of imagination\" needed to upgrade his powers, and bonus items such as complete sets of the character's memories and others. Many of the game's puzzles require the usage of psychic powers, which Raz obtains in a more or less strict order. These powers range from combat abilities such as Psy Shield to Telekinesis (moving objects without touching them) and Clairvoyance (reading other people's minds). \n\nThe camp itself serves as the game's \"hub\", in which the player can explore, interact with characters, search for secret areas and items, and so on.",

Godzilla's power is so feared that scientists have begun experimenting on it's DNA and creating artificial G-Cells of the monster's power. A group of aliens, named the Vortek decide to invade the Earth to take away G-Cells created using Godzilla's DNA. They do this by controlling various other gigantic monsters, who will battle amongst themselves. Only a monster with free-will would be able to destroy the Vortek's army and drive away the Vortek.\n\n<i>Godzilla: Save the Earth</i> is a 3-D Fighting game, somewhat of a sequel to Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee. Players choose from among 18 monsters, previously seen in Godzilla movies, with which to engage in battle and destruction.

      "description": "Area 51, the urban legend, is a U.S. military-controlled base in the Nevada desert, apparently containing a secret aircraft testing facility. It is also famed as the subject of many UFO conspiracy theories. <i>Area-51</i>, the game, is a first-person shooter (FPS) set in this particular base, now infested with rampant aliens and a mutagenic virus that changes your character. As Ethan Cole, Special Forces, specialist in the HAZMAT (hazardous materials) Division, you have to discover what's going on inside the base and blast the menace to save the world. Your character races against time: the same virus that is mutating the facility personnel into monsters is also in his organism, slowly transforming him into an inhuman creature under the control of the alien masterminds.\n\nThe hero has access to more than ten types of human and alien weapons to fight the creatures. They are designed by Stan Winston Studios, monster creator for such films as <i>Aliens</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i> and <i>Predator</i>. The weapons can be used in melee combat as well, and it's possible to switch to an alternate firing mode, in some cases with the downside that it consumes more ammo. Ethan can also use a scanner to investigate items of interest, documents, alien artifacts and residue. The information contributes to the backstory and is stored in the scanner's databank.\n\nAt a specific point in the game, you will gain the ability to mutate into a creature for a limited time. All monsters and humans are then highlighted by your thermal vision, and you can use claws in melee and shoot heat-seeking parasites. Staying in the mutant form consumes mutagen, which can then be replenished by draining infected corpses, killing enemies in melee or consuming special syringes with mutagen, as opposed to using normal medical syringes to restore health.\n\n<i>Area-51</i> has a two-player split-screen and an online multiplayer (for up to 16 players) component with several modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Capture and Hold, and Infection. In Infection, all but one player start as normal healthy soldiers hunting one mutant player. The latter is able to create more mutants by killing opposing players, and thus infecting them.",

Due to some experiments with atomic weaponry, we lack genitalia and the quality of our clones has degraded. Since you pathetic humans all carry Furon DNA in your genetic code, I have been instructed to collect fresh samples. Survival is not an option, but you should be honoured to support the legacy of the Furon Empire!\r\n\r\n<i>Destroy All Humans!</i> is a humorous action game with winks to the era of the goofy fifties' sci-fi movies. Crypto can hypnotize and scan people, and lift objects using psychokinesis. He can also control humans using the Hypno Blast to impose his commands. Extracted DNA can be exchanged in your mothership for new weapons and ability upgrades. Furon weaponry includes a Zap-o-Matic, disintegrator ray, abducto beam, quantum deconstructor and even the famous anal probe. Not to be overpowered, you have to disguise yourself using the Holobob. There are different alert levels, similar to the Grand Theft Auto games and if you are not careful, you will be hunted down by the police, military or the government.\r\n\r\nYou are constantly in contact with the mothership, where you can purchase upgrades, save the game and apply for new missions. Crypto does not have to run all the time, he can also use his flying saucer to abduct humans or animals, cause havoc or face bigger threats. Next to the story-based missions, you will also be instructed to collect specific samples or kill a certain amount of humans in a race against time.",

      "description": "In <i>Advent Rising</i>, you play as Gideon Wyeth, a rookie space pilot. Gideon has a loving fianc\u00e9e and life smiles. That is, until mysterious aliens appear. Gideon and his brother, a hero space pilot, are invited to the historical greeting party. Though the aliens are friendly, they come with a warning about another, vicious race, known as \"the Seekers\", who have decided to exterminate the human race. Soon after, the Seekers invasion begins, and so does the actual game.\n\nThe game itself is a third person shooter with superpowers and a rudimentary melee fighting system. Alternatively, it's possible to switch to a first person perspective, although some abilities cannot be used in this view. Generally you just go around shooting aliens using a new kind of targeting system called flick-targeting. While on Xbox you select targets by tapping thumbsticks towards the foe you want to shoot, on PC this happens by scrolling the mouse wheel (although you can use the mouse for manual aiming and thus avoid scrolling through long list of enemies). You can also gain psychic powers to aid you in combat, ranging from lifting enemies into the air and slowing down time, to creating shields capable of deflecting attacks and smashing enemies with an electromagnetic pulse. These powers work like character upgrades, each one having five mastery levels. Jumping and melee fighting are also upgradeable. As part of the jumping mastery levels, for example, is dodging in slow motion. Just like weapons, in order to use powers they must first be equipped in at least one hand.\n\nDuring gameplay, the HUD shows Gideon's remaining health, the power meter, weapons and powers currently in use, and the number of rounds in the weapon. At first, you must find Nano Aid stations in order to recover health, however once Gideon gains mastery over his health, it simply regenerates if you stay out of harm's way. The power meter decreases every time a power is used, and if it's depleted you must wait for a time before you have access to your powers again.\n\nWhile <i>Advent Rising</i> is mainly a third person shooter, Gideon will have the chance to control the Scythe ATV, turrets and various alien ships. The game has four levels of difficulty (easy, normal, hard and ultra), and uses a checkpoint-based saving system.",

      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

In this game, you play as the zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city.\n\nBefore becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.\n\nLuckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons.",

      "description": "In the 21st century, a dreadful virus wiped out millions. The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below.\r\n\r\nThe world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below.\r\n\r\nOne day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.",

      "description": "<i>Serious Sam II</i> is the sequel to Serious Sam is an equally un-serious first-person shooter with everything blown out of proportion. It offers huge levels with hundreds of opponents, funny worlds with various themes, a vivid colour palette, lots of big guns and some of the largest bosses around (including a giant gorilla, bee, skeleton, dragon and robot). Sam \"Serious\" Stone must fight through the minions of evil mastermind Mental to collect the five pieces of a medallion which will allow him to harm Mental himself.\n\nThe game is based around DOOM's more simple approach to gameplay with a dose of old school game design featuring score, a life-count and extra lives. The outrageous enemies come in waves, dozens at a time, ammo for the basic weapons is plentiful and action almost never ceases. Sometimes a dinosaur, various vehicles (including a flying saucer) and static guns can be mounted to lay waste to Mentals hordes. Weapons include a revolver, shotgun, circular saw, plasma gun, sniper rifle, Uzi, rocket launcher grenade launcher, mini gun, canon and a serious bomb. The game's engine combines support for a high model count on screen at any given time with a long draw distance.\n",

      "description": "<i>The Matrix: Path of Neo</i> is the second video game developed by Shiny Entertainment based on the Matrix trilogy. This time you get to play as Neo himself, starting from the day agents came to take him from his office, through the race against the clock with the machines digging towards Zion, to the final battle against Agent Smith.\n\nLike in the movies you'll start out as the untrained Thomas Anderson, and with the training and events of the movie your skills grow, enabling you to do complicated combos and take down upgraded agents.\n\nAlthough the game follows the events of the trilogy, there are some missions that come as an in-depth look of events only spoken briefly in the films.",

The story takes place 400 years in the future after the majority of Earth's population has been wiped out by industrial disease. Only one city, Bregna, remains. The city is run by the group of scientists who had discovered the vaccine to prevent the disease, but a group of rebels known as the Monicans oppose their rule. \r\n\r\nYou control the main character of the story, Aeon Flux. Aeon is a skilled fighter, and can perform light and heavy strikes, combo attacks, and a variety of acrobatic attacks. When an enemy has only a small amount of health left, you also have the ability to perform a takedown attack; when successful this will award you a bonus, such as extra health. Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage. Aeon is also equipped with a gun called the FUG (Flux Universal Gun) as well as various gadgets. To use the gun you will need ammo which can be picked up at various locations on each level. The various gadgets and gizmos available need to be used to get past certain areas and solve some puzzles; intel capsules provide you with important data, small orbs can be controlled to disable alarms and activate doors, Aeon can hide in rollers to navigate through areas undetected, and more.

Conker now uses a baseball bat instead of the frying pan (his default weapon in the original). A few particularly challenging sequences have been made slightly easier; for example, a crosshair has been added for the slingshot weapon. The remake also censors more swear words with \"beeps\" than the original release.\n\nThe multiplayer game supports up to 16 combatants. This team based game is about the war between two factions: Squirrels and Tediz. Each team has multiple classes as Grunt, Sneaker or Skyjockey, and if the team wishes to reign supreme, they must use the teams effectively as every class has it's own special skills. The game is comprised of two different campaigns: The Future War, and The Old War. Both of these include multiple levels which are played in order to tell a story, and ultimately, defining the winner of the campaign. There are also many vehicles, weapons and items to use which help to win the war.",

Now it's used for a sport called Rumbling, which is a brutal, action filled sport and the stars are customised mecha-like machines which battle against each other in arenas made exclusively for the sport. Little by little, the sport got a foothold and now is one of the most successful things in entertainment.<br><br>\r\nThere is a story mode, which sees the player fight her way through the ranks of opponents, each one a bit harder than previous. She must use the credits won from the battles to soup up the mech with different parts and weapons. One can also choose the coloring of her mech which adds to the uniquity of each fighting machine.\r\nMissiles fly and explosions shatter the ground as these huge metal monsters take on each other both outside and inside buildings, and also the time of day changes so the battle could take place during the day or night. Once in a while, player has to battle a boss and earn some sweet rare parts if it is defeated. \r\nThere is also multiplayer with 2-4 players fighting in split-screen mode.  ",

An expanded single player campaign has you fighting as Vader's 501st Legion of troops, fighting in the Clone Wars as the undercurrent of evil, soon to be known as the Empire, takes its place in the Galaxy.\n\nNow you can also take to the stars in specially developed multiplayer levels where your skill in an X-Wing or TIE-Fighter come to the fore. Defeat enemy ships and destroy the heavy cruisers and capital ships to achieve victory, or land within enemy territory and blow up a Star Destroyer from the inside.",
