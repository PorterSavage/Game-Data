      "description": "In 1981, a sequel to Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>.  This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

      "description": "A port of the arcade game, <i>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</i> is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the <i>Gauntlet</i> games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. \n\nThis version contains the characters and levels from <i>Gauntlet: Legends</i>, plus the new characters and levels from the <i>Dark Legacy</i> arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.\n\nThere are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. \n\nUnlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.\n\nWhile levels can be gained and characters saved, <i>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</i> is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.",

      "description": "A beat'em'up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around \"grooves\" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.\n\nThe \"EO\" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.\n\nPlayable characters come from the following games:\n<ul>\n<li>Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)</li>\n<li>Final Fight (Rolento)\n<li>Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega)</li>\n<li>Final Fight 2 (Maki)\n<li>Super Street Fighter II (Cammy)</li>\n<li>Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Akuma/Gouki)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha (Dan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Sakura, Shin Akuma/Gouki, Evil Ryu)</li>\n<li>Darkstalkers (Morrigan)</li>\n<li>Street Fighter III (Yun)</li>\n<li>Rival Schools (Kyosuke)</li>\n<li>Psycho Soldier (Athena)\n<li>Fatal Fury (Terry, Joe, Raiden, Geese)\n<li>Art of Fighting (Ryo, Yuri, King, Todoh)\n<li>Fatal Fury 2 (Kim, Mai)\n<li>Samurai Shodown (Haohmaru, Nakoruru)\n<li>The King of Fighters '94 (Kyo, Benimaru, Chang&Choi, Rugal)</li>\n<li>The King of Fighters '95 (Iori)\n<li>Fatal Fury 3 (Yamazaki)\n<li>The King of Fighters '96 (Vice)\n<li>The King of Fighters '97 (Orochi Iori)\n<li>The Last Blade 2(Hibiki)\n<li>Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves (Rock)\n</ul>\n",

      "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\n<i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i> takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, even those that never appear in <i>Dynasty Warriors 3</i>.",

This is as arcade as it gets.  Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.\r\n\r\nGraphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents.  Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.",

      "description": "Tommy Angelo was an ordinary taxi driver trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, until one day an unexpected meeting changed his life forever. Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice.\n\n Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.\n\n<i>Mafia</i> is an action and driving game set in the 1930's in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era.  Similarly to GTA games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.\n\nThe player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period.  Each car handles differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.\n\nComplementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious.  If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.\n\nTommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired in the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.",

Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.\r\n\r\nChoose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.\r\n\r\nThe competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.",

      "description": "TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design's PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between.\n\nThe game's story finds Cortez, the series' hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.\n\nLike its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).\n\nThe Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills. \n\n\n",

The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.",

Along the way, she will also discover her own destiny, and the mystery surrounding her new friend.\n\nSimply put, you have limited control of the dragon for most of the game, as your trigger finger will be shooting non-stop at the enemies that fly around the area. Orta will be your main source of fire-power when you simply press the fire button, but by pressing and holding, the aim cursor will change, allowing you to fire a burst of power from the dragon at whatever the cursor aims at. \n\nThe dragon itself can change into three forms at a press of a button. Each form has a different style of attack and power ability.\n\nA port of the original Panzer Dragoon is included.",

In the garage, the player may customize the appearance of their car with stickers and body parts previously won. It's also possible to tune the car by adjusting brakes, suspension, tires, etc. \n\nThe US version of the game also supports on-line play (broadband only).",

Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.\n\nThe gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the \"Advanced system\" from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.",

Perform power slides, 360\u00b0 turns, drive on two wheels or stay in the slipstream of your opponents to build up a stash. With those points, you can unlock new venues and faster race monsters, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Porsche GT2, BMW Z4, Pontiac GTO, Mini Cooper S and many others.\n\nThe game can be played both over System Link as Xbox Live. You can race friends online or download ghosts of the fastest drivers all around the world to improve your own skills.\n\nEach city has its own soundtrack, but you can create and store your own playlists as well.\n",

      "description": "<i>Wrath Unleashed</i> is a strategy game with both turn-based and real-time components, as well as action-oriented battles, similar in concept to Archon: The Light and the Dark. The gods of the four Elements (Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind) inhabit an asteroid belt, the only remnant of their former world, which has been shattered to pieces. The gods are waging war on each other, each trying to reclaim the coveted throne of Gaia. Each of the gods represents an alignment: Light Order, Light Chaos, Dark Order, or Dark Chaos, ranging from the most benevolent to the most evil. Their armies consist of supernatural creatures. The player can choose to command any of the armies, taking it to victory through four campaign missions each.\n\nIn the game's campaign mode, the units are navigated in turn-based fashion over a board of hexagonal spaces, each representing a type of terrain. The main objectives of this strategic part of the game usually involve occupying the opposing army's temples or defeating specific enemies. When two opposing units meet on the same hexagonal space, a battle ensues. The battles take place on large arenas, and are a combination of real-time strategy and pure action. The player can take control of individual fighters and engage in direct arcade-like combat against the opponents.\n\nVersus and team fighter modes are available, both removing all the strategic elements, retaining only the action battles. Also included is an editor that allows players to create and customize their own soldiers and units.",

Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era.  In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo.  Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.\r\n\r\nBasically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors.  The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies.  In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers.  In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas.  In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.  Updated graphics and a more \"techno-ish\" soundtrack top off the additions.",

The game can be played from any of 12 different camera setups (for instance complete overview, ball close-up, ball follow or traditional scrolling style). This has been made possible through use of real-time 3D graphics. The game also features spot-on flipper control featuring a multiball enabled physics engine that calculates the ball movement more than 1500 times per second.\n\nThe Xbox version contains one extra table, with an outer space theme, and allows sharing high-scores over Xbox Live.",

      "description": "This game is the successor to Ricochet Xtreme. It's a Breakout variant, so you have your little ship (the paddle) at the bottom of the playfield, which initially shoots a ball, and then reflect it back into the playfield. Your mission is to destroy all bricks in the game. Once all are removed, you proceed to the next level.\n\nUnique (at least I didn't saw it elsewhere) about the bricks is, that there are not only fixed and straight moving bricks, but there is also \"vibration\" in some levels. In example in the Underwater World, bricks will swing in complex patterns, both up/down or left/right, some of them even \"fly\" more chaotic.\n\nThe game offers 4 different main worlds (like Underwater, Volcano, or an Alien world) with 4 sub-worlds each. Each of the sub-worlds have 10 levels, so you can play 160 different levels. There are 4 different difficulty settings available.\n\nOn your journey through the game, you encounter lots of usual Power-Ups, like Small/Big Ball, Slow/Fast Ball, Catcher (to prevent loosing the ball), Multiball, 8-Ball, Laser equipped paddle, the all destroying ball (here it's the corrosive ball). But there also Power-Ups to create new balls (not through multiplying), Power-Ups that change the type of other bricks. Or how about a laser firing ball? But there are much more things in the game.",

As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.\n\nAs most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called \"buzzing\" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. \n\nAs in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an  extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.",

The standard Arcade, Versus, and Practice modes return, as well as new items to be found in the Krypt. In addition, there are new Konquest Adventure, Chess Kombat, and Puzzle Kombat modes to give the player new mini-games.\n\nThere are a dozen <i>Mortal Kombat</i> fighters selectable at the start of the game, including both old favorites and mysterious newcomers. Longtime fans of the series will recognize veterans of the earliest <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games, such as Sub-Zero and Scorpion, Kabal, Baraka, Mileena, Ermac, and Nightwolf, who are joined by relative newcomers like Bo'Rai Cho, who debuted in Deadly Alliance. The game also introduces nine new fighters, Ashrah, Dairou, Darrius, Havik, Hotaru, Kira, Shujinko, Onaga, and Kobra, each with a distinctly new fighting style intended to balance the deadly abilities of the other characters.\n\nThe Playstation 2 and Xbox versions offer online, competitive play against other players. The Gamecube version does not include online play, but offers Goro and Shao Kahn as exclusive playable characters.",

      "description": "The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...\n\nThis year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).\n\nLike The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.",

The story takes place 400 years in the future after the majority of Earth's population has been wiped out by industrial disease. Only one city, Bregna, remains. The city is run by the group of scientists who had discovered the vaccine to prevent the disease, but a group of rebels known as the Monicans oppose their rule. \r\n\r\nYou control the main character of the story, Aeon Flux. Aeon is a skilled fighter, and can perform light and heavy strikes, combo attacks, and a variety of acrobatic attacks. When an enemy has only a small amount of health left, you also have the ability to perform a takedown attack; when successful this will award you a bonus, such as extra health. Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage. Aeon is also equipped with a gun called the FUG (Flux Universal Gun) as well as various gadgets. To use the gun you will need ammo which can be picked up at various locations on each level. The various gadgets and gizmos available need to be used to get past certain areas and solve some puzzles; intel capsules provide you with important data, small orbs can be controlled to disable alarms and activate doors, Aeon can hide in rollers to navigate through areas undetected, and more.

Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.\r\n\r\nThis version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.\r\n\r\nDefeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.\r\n\r\nThe newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.",

      "description": "Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).\n\nThe heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you.\n\nTo make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.\n\nBut the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don't find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.",

The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.\n\nThere are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer: OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars.\n\nIn every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations.\n\nIf you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.",

      "description": "The space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, has turned the world of Mardar into living hell. Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole.  But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that carries her is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape.  Her first target, unsurprisingly, is Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. His ship becomes entangled into her world, and he has to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations. \n\n <i>Xyanide</i> is essentially a 2D shooter, though technically, the graphics are three-dimensional. The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.\n\nDrake's ship has two primary weapons, which can be switched at any time. One is a spread attack normally used against small enemies; the other is a concentrated laser that's effective against bigger targets. Both weapons also have an alternate firing mode, homing missiles. All these can be upgraded during the course of the game. Collecting power-ups not only strengthens the weapons, but allows the ship to perform various offensive and defensive manoeuvres.\n\nThe game is story-driven; animated cutscenes appear between the levels, advancing the plot.

However for GG Isuka the battles are 2-on-2 instead of 1-on-1, taking place in multi-plane arenas (similar to Fatal Fury) and requiring the players to switch orientation manually.\n\nAdded features include two new characters (only one playable), new backgrounds and game modes including the new \"Boost\" mode, which turns the game into a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",

It's up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power.\n\n<i>Night of the Quinkan</i> is the third game in the Ty series.  As Ty, players can bite at foes, or use his boomerangs for consecutive ranged attacks.  Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways: either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang's chassis.  Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking.  Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game's currency.\n\nTy 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns).  Ty can even take part in cart races against other characters for powerups and even more opals.",

The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously.\n\nAlthough cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match. Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.\n\nMultiplayer comes with different game modes. Traditional Last Man Standing is supplemented with multiple variations. A Hunter game-type, where one car is designated a target and points can only be scored by hitting it. There is also a score target which encourages going for the big points hits and stunts, rather than destroying competitors. Others are defensive and offensive driving challenges and a game type where only points scored by performing jumps and stunts are counted. Multiplayer is supported through 4-player split-screen, but no through Xbox Live play or the system link.",

      "description": "<i>Egg Mania</i> is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.\n\nThere are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.\n\nCompared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.",

      "description": "<i>Magi Death Fight</i> is a top-down action game. There are two game modes: a single-player/cooperative campaign and multiplayer deathmatch mode, supporting up to four players. The game takes place in an arena. Four different color balls of magic energy float around randomly in the arena, and can be picked up and fired at your foes. By holding down the fire button you can control how far the ball shoots. The balls do no damage until the end of their travel, at which point they explode, damaging whatever is beneath them.\n\nYou can pick up in total four balls of energy to orbit your character before you can pick up no more. If you collect all of one color, then this charges up your blast to be much more powerful than simply your regular fired ball. For example, a full four blue water magics will cause a stream of water to be released at the end of your shot, flowing down the screen from that point through all walls and obstacles and hitting everything underneath its path. If you collect one of each color, then this will cause you to release an 8-way explosion of regular shots careening randomly in every direction. There's also chests scattered randomly around the battlefield, and inside are various power-ups (as well as power-downs) that affect your character in various ways: speed boost, homing shots, guided shots, etc.",

      "description": "<i>Pump It Up: Exceed</i> is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The <i>Pump It Up</i> dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.\n\nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the <i>Pump It Up</i> dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.\n\nThe game has several mode to choose from:\n<ul>\n<li>Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an  \u201cA\u201d or an \u201cS\u201d rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.\n<li>Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.\n<li>Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. \n<li>Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\n<li>Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\n<li>Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\n</ul>\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \n\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs.  As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.

      "description": "Furious Karting is a kart racing game. Choosing from one of two racer clans, players race across tracks ranging from seedy slums to shopping malls. While the game in itself plays very much like a whimsical and cartoony kart racer, it includes several elements not seen in other kart racing games, such as the usage of a aluminum bat to knock off enemies, which impacts your karma meter and is used in how other racers will treat you in future races, this can be countered with apologizing. There's also a trick system, if used correctly, can give you a temporary speed boost. Typical kart racing powerups such as speed boosts and rockets can be used to stall or slow down other racers. \n\nThere are two multiplayer modes that can be played up to 4 players on the Xbox system, such as the \"classic\" mode, which is the base single player game and \"Jam\" mode, where players must acquire a CD and hold onto it for a limited time to be declared the winner.\n\n",
