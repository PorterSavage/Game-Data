      "description": "One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, <em>Pac-Man</em> stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\n\nPac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.",

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.\n ",

      "description": "<i>Moon Patrol</i> is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate \"stage\" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. \n\nDangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. \n\nAfter completing the first course (the \"Beginner Course\") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course.

This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...\n\n<i>Bubble Bobble</i> is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.",

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the \"Black Warriors\", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.\n\nUsing whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.\n\nThe NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.",

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.\n\nThe original arcade version of \"Double Dragon II\" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, \"Double Dragon II\" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.\n\nThe NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.",

      "description": "<i>Onimusha: Warlords</i> is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. \n\nWith this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.\n\nThe 2018 enhanced HD version for Windows and consoles now supports 16:9 wide screen resolution as well as the old 4:3 ratio. Improved controls now allow players to move and fight with analog-stick precision. ",

Characters can now roll forward and backward, perform small jumps to evade low attacks, and duck to avoid high ones. There is also a parrying move that leaves the opponent vulnerable for a moment if executed at the right time.",

      "description": "The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by \"Eos\". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive \"Red Faction\". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and its workers, any little incident could ignite...\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> is a first-person shooter. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in a less protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most of which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> features a game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths,  tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.",

      "description": "Max Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.\n\n<i>Max Payne</i> is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, \"hardboiled\" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called <i>Bullet Time</i> - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first  Matrix movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.\n\nCutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs.

      "description": "400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more: the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie.\n\n<i>Dark Cloud</i> is an action-RPG title, often compared to Soul Blazer, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another.\n\nToan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes.\n\nEach character in Toan's party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as \"experience\" for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon's abilities. Each weapon features a number of \"slots\" to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to \"build up\" to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.",

Every level consists of running forward blasting anything that moves, while collecting power-ups along the way (there's also a wide selection of weaponry in the game). In the end of each level the player goes up against one gigantic boss. \n\nThe PlayStation port introduces some extra features: there is a combat school where the player may fight with other players for the best time on each level and an art gallery.",

      "description": "\"Violent fighting to come again!\"\n\nSNK's flagship series returns for another year. Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of \"Rush\" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '96</i> has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default \"Team Fighting\" mode or the traditional \"Single Fighter\" style of gameplay, plus the \"Versus\" and \"Survival\" gameplay modes.",

      "description": "Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain \"Edit Team\" combinations are selected.\n\nAs of <i>The King of Fighters '97</i>, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent \"Super Desperation Move\" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.\n\nNew characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of \"Blue\" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, <i>The King of Fighters '97</i> sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all accessible via a secret code).",

Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden \"alternate\" versions that may also be used in-game. \n\nKOF '98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters '97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes. In addition to the Survival battle mode and the ability to choose between Single Play or Team Play, versions of the game on console systems that use CDs to contain their media (PSX, Neo-Geo CD) also include an Art Gallery one may look at.",

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '95</i> introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of <i>The King of Fighters '95</i> is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the \"team edit\" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the \"team edit\" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.",

      "description": "After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime.  During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime.  Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude.  Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process.  Now it is time for revenge.  Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others.  Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way.  It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i> is similar in its concept to its predecessors: the player is cast in the role of a vicious (albeit novice) criminal, who performs tasks for crime lords and gradually raises his rank in the criminal world. Driving is the main gameplay element in the game, though the player can also fully explore the city on foot. For the first time in the series, the entire game is rendered in 3D. Different camera angles are available for driving, and free camera rotation is available when on foot. \n\nAs opposed to the previous games, Liberty City is the only city the player can explore in the game. The game puts more emphasis on the story, displaying cutscenes before each mission. In order to complete the game it is necessary to perform all the main story missions; however, the player often has the choice between several missions at a given moment. The missions include chases, races, short third-person shooter sequences, as well as various mini-game-like activities. Outside of the missions, the player is free to explore the city and undertake sub-missions, for example working as a taxi driver, delivering sick people to the hospital in an ambulance car, etc. ",

A new opponent, Wolfgang Krauser, has come forth to begin a new Fatal Fury tournament. The Lone Wolves return, with new faces amongst them. Only one can be declared the winner though. \n\nThe player can choose one from eight playable characters: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Big Bear, Jubei Yamada, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, and Mai Shiranui. The game has four bosses. The combat system is more complex than in the first game, supporting four keys to attack. The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.\n",

      "description": "The story of this game is based on <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>, the first of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.\n\nMost of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.\n\nSome of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.\n\nThe PlayStation ports of the SNES version have updated controller and display options, leaderboards, new save options, and Trophies.",

There Daxter accidentally falls into a pool of evil Dark Eco, and transforms into a weasel-like creature. Bringing Daxter to his original human form is enough of a problem, and now the Lurkers are using this Dark Eco for their own malign intentions. The plot goes on as the game plays.\n\nOur hero(es) can jump, double-jump, spin-kick, uppercut, hang onto things, and ride various vehicles and an occasional creature along the way to complete their assigned tasks. There are also several NPCs to interact with and play their side quests and mini-games. ",

      "description": "The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, <i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters '99. This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the \"alternate\" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden \"maniac\" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.",

      "description": "Tommy Vercetti is a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends.  Because he didn't rat out his \"family\", Tommy's sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything.  Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it's up to Tommy to clear a path.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> offers the same free-roaming driving and action gameplay style as its predecessor, but in a new setting based on the city of Miami. The game includes all the features of the previous installment and builds upon them. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of typical vehicles from the 1980's. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from <i>GTA III</i>. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat.\n\nNew to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFirearms are for the most part the same as in <i>GTA III</i>, and melee weapons have been added to the protagonist's arsenal. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Activities outside of the missions (driving taxis, delivering sick people to hospitals, firefighting and playing a vigilante policeman) are available as well.\n\nTo effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured in the previous game) across ten radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as <i>I Ran</i> by Flock of Seagulls, <i>The Message</i> by Grandmaster Flash, <i>You've Got Another Thing Coming</i> by Judas Priest, and <i>Out of Touch</i> by Hall & Oates.",

As the Ninja's take damage their classic Ninja garb is torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head.

Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. \r\n\r\nThis aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.",

      "description": "<i>Resident Evil: Zero</i> takes place before the events of the original Resident Evil. You take on the role as one of two characters; Rebecca Chambers, the Bravo team medic encountered in the first game, and Billy Coen, an ex-con being transported. The game begins with the Bravo team flying overhead, en route to investigate a series of murders.  Something happens, and the helicopter crashes.  Everyone survives, but when they all start searching, they encounter an overturned military transport truck, with nothing but corpses inside.  Rebecca Chambers, the youngest member of S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, goes to investigate the Umbrella Company Luxury Train, which has mysteriously stalled in the middle of the woods. You now take control of Rebecca, and your journey begins.\n\nIn addition to the series' traditional survival horror gameplay, the game introduces what it calls a \"partner zapping\" system, which allows you to switch between Rebecca and Billy at any time. This feature must be used at times, as the game requires both characters to work together to solve some puzzles. New to the game are a bunch of terrifying enemies, like the mutant centipede, new areas to explore, and the ability to drop items on the ground instead of having to find an item box.\n\nUnlike the original GameCube release, all enhanced ports later on feature an additional Wesker mode which gets unlocked after completing the game. That mode adds two new costumes, a red-eye controlled Rebecca look and a Wesker look for Billy with certain special abilities for Wesker. Both skins seem to have been based on Wesker and Jill from <i>Resident Evil 5</i> which came after the GameCube release of this game.",

Chosen to be the blue-print for the Clone Army, Jango must now prove himself in order to gain the biggest job on the streets, wiping out the deadly cult, Bando Gora. Every other bounty hunter in the galaxy is willing and able to do the job, so you must work hard to gain the contract from Darth Tyranus.\n\nTo win the contract, you must complete a range of missions and collect the bounties on worlds very familiar to Star Wars fans. Jango has his trusty dual pistols to help him out, but also has the ability to use his flame thrower, jet pack, poison darts and much more.  Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level.  Jango must identify them with his helmet gear, and catch them alive...or dead.  Bounties allow the player to unlock bonus materials.\n\nThe 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs.  Bounty Hunter also connects to the movies in that it explains how Jango became the model for the Clone Army of the Republic, and how he became acquainted with Zam Wesell, who makes an appearance in the movies.",

Every third level is a \"challenge stage\" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.\n\nCertain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last \"life,\" you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.\n\nA summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final \"hit ratio\"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.",

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.\n\nAs the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.\n\nAs was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

In this platform game it's your goal to catch all the apes jumping, walking and flying around the diverse levels the game has to offer.\n\nA large arsenal of gadgets can be used to make it all a little easier, with the catching net being the most important weapons of them all. Other gadgets include a RC Car, to drive over monkey's and collect objects, an Ape Radar, to detect the nearest monkey, a baseball bat, to hit monkeys unconscious, and a magnet, to move certain objects in the maps.\n\nYour quest is to catch all monkeys in the levels and to stop the evil Specter from taking over the world. All monkeys in the levels are somewhat unique with their own character abilities and their unique name. Some monkeys just sit on their place, while others attack you with projectiles or run away quickly. ",

More often than not, the \"power ball\" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the \"E\" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.\n\nThe more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.",

A strange and powerful creature attacks Lewis after a concert and runs off into the night with him, leaving Jen injured and near-death.\n\nJen meets a short gargoyle named Scree, who informs her that she must leave the physical plane Mortalis and accompany him to the demon plane Oblivion.  The creature who kidnapped Lewis and left her for dead is an agent of Abaddon who represents Chaos and has been locked in struggle for aeons with Arella, representing Order. The balance between Chaos and Order has been upset and it is Jen's task to restore the balance, all the while hoping to discover the whereabouts of Lewis.\n\n<i>Primal</i> can be described as a \"3D platformer\", being somewhat similar in its basic gameplay mechanics to  Tomb Raider games. Puzzle-solving and action-based combat constitute the focus of the gameplay. The player can switch between Jen and Scree at any time; Jen is capable of fighting, but Scree is invulnerable to enemy attacks. When Jen is incapacitated in combat, Scree must quickly restore her to life within a time limit; failure to do so prematurely ends the game.\n\nCombat is heavily based on \"finishing moves\" and Jen's ability to transform into demonic forms. There are four demons Jen can merge herself with; they are obtained one by one as the game's narrative advances. These demonic forms allow Jen to use special abilities, which include jumping to extreme heights, unnaturally fast swimming, slowing down time, and using powerful weapons.",

After completing their quest from the original title, Jak and Daxter are shot into another time and space and the future of their planet, and everything is different. The two are split up, with Jak thrown into jail by Baron Praxis, the ruler of Haven City. For two years Jak is experimented on with dark Eco, turning him into an almost Hulk-like character, mean and filled with rage. \n\nRescued by Daxter, the two must set off and find a way to shut down the operation and get revenge for Jak's uncontrollable change. Along the way they will meet new friends and deadly enemies (known as Metal Heads), but at least now Jak has something special on his side: weapons, and lots of them. Including a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon. Gameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights).",

      "description": "You are Agent 17 (codename: \"Otto\"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.\n\nEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:<ul>\n<li>Shooting them with his gun.</li>\n<li>Kicking them by jumping onto them.</li>\n<li>Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.</li>\n<li>Crushing them with an elevator.</li>\n</ul>Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. \n\nJust because the game is called <i>Elevator Action</i> doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.",

      "description": "<i>Manhunt</i> casts you as James Earl Cash, a prisoner on death row.  You are led down a corridor where you are about to receive a lethal injection.  The needle goes in.  You wake up hours later.  A mysterious voice tells you to stick in the nearby earpiece, and explains that the \"lethal\" injection was just a heavy sedative.  The man, later identified as Starkweather, turns out to be a director of snuff movies, where the people are really killed.  He explains that if you follow his directions, manage to kill people and survive, you'll earn your freedom.  This begins James Earl Cash's journey.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, you'll have to make your way through different locales, such as a city and a mall, while killing gangs.  You'll face lots of different gangs, from The Hoods and The Skins to tougher gangs like The Innocenz.  Gang members carry weapons ranging from pistols and shotguns to knives and glass shards.\n\n<i>Manhunt</i> is primarily a stealth game.  You'll have to hide behind walls, flatten yourself against walls, crouch, hide behind objects, and walk to avoid attracting attention.  You can also throw glass bottles to create a distraction, or you can punch surfaces and yell to get gangs to come to you.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from the traditional, such as the shotgun and uzi, to the disgusting, such as a sickle and plastic bag.  Each weapon has three different ways of attacking, depending on how long you hold the button.  A quick attack will do the job, a medium attack will be bloody, but a high attack, requiring the longest amount of time, will earn you the most points, and will allow you to see your kill in a cinematic style, with blood splatting on the camera, and gurgling noises.\n\n<i>Manhunt</i> also lets you use a USB headset, such as the one that came included with SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals.  With the headset, you will hear Starkweather speak into your ears instead of through your speakers, and you will be able to shout into the microphone to attract gangs instead of pressing a button.",

Missiles, tanks, UFO's, and other enemy artillery can all be found and will try to stop you. Colliding with any of these enemies, enemy fire, or the landscape will cause you to lose one of your planes. To fight back, your plane is equipped with both bombs and guns which can destroy most of the enemies you'll encounter. Your plane has a limited amount of fuel, and you'll crash if you run out. To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally. ",

      "description": "Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team's helicopter malfunctioned and crashed during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out.\n\nYou play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival.\n\nThe GameCube and the later Wii versions are largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.\n\nThe 2015 PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows version called <i>Resident Evil</i> (also known as <i>Biohazard: HD Remaster</i>) is a remastered version of GameCube remake of the original <i>Resident Evil</i> with enhanced graphics and sounds, widescreen support and an alternative control scheme next to the default one. Additionally, when starting a new game, the player can choose between original character models, or Chris and Jill models from Resident Evil 5 which came after the original GameCube release.",

In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.\n\nThe arcade version doesn't allow you to play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.",

To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.",

      "description": "Orphaned by bandits and left for dead on the frontier, Red Harlow grew up with a scar burned into his hand and the lust for revenge burned into his heart.  Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge.\n\n<i>Red Dead Revolver</i> features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne.  The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier).  Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's \"Dead-Eye\" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid \"fan fire\" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons.\n\nBeating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money).  You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite.\n\nThe game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun.  There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots.  Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action.",

      "description": "As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.\nWhile climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:<ul><li>Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.</li>\n<li>Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.</li>\n<li>Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.</li>\n<li>Electrical \"Nichibutsu\" signs with a dangling live wire.</li>\n<li>Falling \"Crazy Climber\" signs.</li>\n<li>King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.</li></ul>The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. \n\nCrazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is \"The Lucky Balloon\", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.",

Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.\n",

      "description": "An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.\n\nMag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature. ",

One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.\n\nGameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights). Weapons including the shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon from the previous game as well as two upgrades for each weapon.

      "description": "This is the scrolling beat 'em up by Technos which started the Kunio / Nekketsu High series. The original takes takes place in a Japanese city, whereas its western version named <i>Renegade</i> is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn. This conversion later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter.  You must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.",

      "description": "Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.\n\n<i>Resident Evil 4</i> is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. \n\nThe entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous \"merchant\" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.\n\nThere is also <i>the Mercenaries</i> from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.\n\nUnlike the original GameCube release, later released platforms come with a bonus story mode called <i>Separate Ways</i> which becomes unlocked after finishing the main game. This story lets you play as Ada Wong and occurs in parallel to the main story, showing you what Ada did, who she contacted and where she's been when she wasn't with Leon. While most of the locations and weapons are the same, there are some entirely new levels and Ada's personal gadgets not previously seen in the main story.",

Blue was summoned to get rid of the Daruma tribe, and save Raguy from the Daruma Empire that has turned the inhabitants into slaves.\r\n\r\nYou control Blue, who only has one weapon to deal with the Darumas. You can use his leaf to whip enemies upside-down, and hurl these enemies at others. Along the way, you can get flowers for use at the shop to buy items that will help you along the way. These items include flower honey (increases stamina), swim fins (easier swimming), light safe (protects all your items), spikes, and ocarinas. Later in the game, you can also get the shopkeeper to sing you a song. This helps you break curses that are placed on you by a witch.You will also interact with other characters along the way that can also help you if you tell the truth.\r\n\r\nYou exit each stage by jumping on a huge plant. The higher up you are on this plant, the more points you are awarded. Every two or so stages, you have to defeat a boss before a guy in a devil suit offers you something.

Unfortunately, the Cyber-Lip Master Defense Computer decides to use this army to attack the humans in the colony. With a legion of robotic troops marching into battle against the colony, the humans are left to fend for themselves. Two soldiers have been assigned the task of taking on the mechanical army with the hopes and prayers of all humanity on their shoulders.\n\n<i>Cyber-Lip</i> is a 1-2 player side-scrolling game where you must fight your way through several areas, and defeat a boss at the end of each one. Along the way, you can pick up a variety of weapons along the way, and use them against the invaders. By destroying certain enemies, you receive a \"core bot\", which is a ring that surrounds you, and when this touches the invaders, they are destroyed. Time is against you. When it expires, you lose a life.\n\nBetween most levels, you enter an elevator that allows you to go in whatever direction that you please: up or down. If you wait to long to make a selection, you are automatically placed in the \"Danger\" mission.",

Each weapon has its disadvantages. The gun, for example, will only have so many bullets per life, and the knife will decrease in strength with every use. During your mission, you will also earn experience points, and meet and free hostages along the way. These hostages will heal you, fix your knife, and give you a machine gun. Some floors end with you defeating a boss, while others end at elevators. You must reach the top of the building where you will confront the leader.",

You and/or a friend must choose one of three characters to play as, each with different speeds at which they control their ships. Then select three weapons to use for the front and back of your ship. During play, you must travel to every planet in the solar system, and defeat the various enemy ships and the boss near the end of the planet. Your weapons can be upgraded during the battle, and you can also collect HyperBombs if you want to do maximum damage. The soundtrack is reminiscent of early 1990's \"rave\" music.",

      "description": "<i>Windjammers</i> is based on a real-life sport known as Saucer Tennis or Frisbee Tennis. You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly.\r\n\r\nThere are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.\r\n\r\nFor the futuristic touch, signature moves are added. To charge these special moves, you need to block, toss or lob the disc and then charge while the disc is in the air. These moves can be countered and sometimes they knock an opponent into the goal.\r\n\r\nTwo mini-games are included in-between levels: play fetch with a dog and Flying Disc Bowling.",

      "description": "This is the first game of the series that conquered legions of fighter fans from all over the world. <i>The King of Fighters '94</i> joins together fighters from other SNK Corporation franchises: Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, Takuma Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki, King), Fatal Fury (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan) and Ikari Warriors (Ralf Jones, Clark Steel, Heidern), as well as totally new fighters such as Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, and Goro Daimon (from the Japanese team).\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '94</i> is notable in that it is one of the first known fighting games that pits a team of fighters against each other in single combat. Each team consists of three fighters for each player, the winner being the player who is able to eliminate the other team first. Each active character can charge up \"Art of Fighting\" style in order to gain access to \"Desperation Moves\", or \"DMs\" (moves which operate very much like Street Fighter's Super Combos). Playing against the computer, the player must defeat all 8 teams in the game in order to reach the final boss, Rugal Bernstein.",
