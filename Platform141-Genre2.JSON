      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

He has to return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.\n\nIt is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen, but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the same time.",

Recognized by his unique habit of leaving an origami figure at the center of his crimes, the serial killer has taken another victim. With his pattern of killing his victims within four days time is running out to save him. This is where the lives of four characters become entangled as they all search to stop the Origami Killer: Ethan Mars, a former architect overcome with depression and guilt over an accident leading to one of his son's death; Norman Jayden, an FBI profiler investigating the Origami case using an experimental device known as ARI (Added Reality Interface); Madison Paige, a nightmare filled journalist who unexpectedly finds her way into the investigation; and Scott Shelby, a private eye hired by families of victims of the serial killer to find things the authorities may have missed.\n\n<i>Heavy Rain</i> is an interactive drama title combining adventure and action elements. The story revolves around the lives of four characters as they try to stop the Origami Killer from taking the life of another victim. The game has a heavy emphasis on user choices, with different decisions you make completely changing the way the story unfolds and which will lead to one of the many possible endings the game offers. There is no game-over screen if one of or all of the main characters die, there will just be a different ending given. \n\nSimilar to Quantic Dream's previous title Indigo Prophecy/Fahrenheit, the game is moved along primarily by the use of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Movement of your character is done by holding the R2 button and choosing a direction with the left analog stick. Holding the L2 button brings up your characters thoughts and pressing the button to go along with each thought will lead him/her to say or do something.\n\nBudget re-release of <i>Heavy Rain</i> includes game patch to support PlayStation Move controller (the patch can also be downloaded as standalone for free). That includes budget releases such as Platinum (in Europe), Greatest Hits (in America), or PlayStation 3 the Best (in Asia).",

Soon he discovers that the country inhabitants are being oppressed by their emperor. Hakuoro organizes a rebellion, and eventually becomes the emperor himself. Determined to bring peace to the world, Hakuoro must nevertheless fight against countries who oppose his benevolent rule, and discover the truth about his own past in the process.\n\n<i>Utawarerumono</i> is a turn-based tactical RPG with elements of a visual novel. Much of the narrative develops through text and still images, with the player being able to make a choice from time to time. Battles occur as dictated by the narrative. The player navigates the characters on the battle field, attacking enemies when they are in range. Experience points are gained after the victory, and are distributed to raise the parameters of the characters.\n\nThe original PC version has explicit sexual scenes, which have been removed for the PS2 release.",

      "description": "Tomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student whose mother died when he was young, leaving his father to raise him. Severe drinking problems caused Tomoya's father to become violent; during one of the quarrels, he injured his son. Their relationship has seemingly improved since then, but Tomoya's injuries, mental and physical, have led him to a delinquent life. This changes when he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who gets sick easily. Tomoya begins to help her reform a drama club she failed to join last year, and gradually changes his view about life.\n\n<i>Clannad</i> is a visual novel. The game is dedicated to the development of the story, displayed as still images accompanied by text. The player's interaction is confined to occasional \"decision points\", which prompt him to make choices for Tomoya, altering subsequent events. The game is divided into two parts; the second one describes the lives of its main characters some time after the conclusion of the first one. In order to access the second part, the player has to play through all the scenarios of the first one, which are only possible to achieve by replaying it and making different choices each time.",

      "description": "<i>The Journey Down: Chapter One</i> is the first episode of an adventure game series made as a remake of the freeware game The Journey Down: Over the Edge. This first episode largely follows the events of the original game, but with high resolution 2D graphics, new cut-scenes in 3D, improved music, more puzzles, new scenes and characters, and full voice-overs.\n\nThe player controls Bwana, a rasta-styled character who runs the gas station Bwana's Gas 'n' Charter with his partner Kito. They are visited by Lina, an assistant at Agibo University. In the introduction the office of a professor is raided by two criminals. Lina visits to find an old book that belongs to Kaonandodo, a former sea captain and the owner of the gas station, who disappeared one day when the two were just kids. He took Bwana and Kito under his wing when they burgled the gas station and then raised them and convinced them to become his employees. The book Lina is after is called the Journal of the Journey Down, a collection of notes and scribbles on how to reach the Underland, a part of the world past the edge where a powerful firm attempts to prevent people from visiting. Lina wants to get past the edge using Bwana's plane. Most of this first episode is spent restoring the main parts of the plane and it ends when the three manage to take off.\n\nThe game is played as a classic point-and-click adventure. Players guide Bwana through different scenes and text appears over objects that can be interacted with. There is only one action possible, so conversations, examining, using or picking up are triggered automatically based on the context. Items can be gathered to be stored in an inventory near the bottom of the screen, where they can also be combined. Most of the puzzles are based on interaction with the environment, but there are also a few that require some more thinking. Conversations have different options and it is not possible to die in the game.",

But of course there is no way up \u2014 however, the egocentric inventor Rufus, the hero of the game, tries all he can to get there...\n\nThis is a traditional point & click adventure in which the player needs to solve puzzle chains in order to achieve the chapter's big goal. The puzzles range from inventory puzzles (combining found items in the inventory with each other or with items in the game world), dialogue puzzles and logic puzzles like setting railway switches. The latter are isolated from the regular game environment and can be mostly skipped. Of course the game also offers the usual hot spot help which shows all interactive items on the screen. Besides the puzzle solving, one of the most important aspects of the game are the characters and their development over the course of the game.",

This time, Goal's memory and character is damaged in such a way that it can only be stored on three separate disks. Rufus can remotely up- and download these three different personalities so he can use each when the occasion calls for it. Other types of puzzles include inventory puzzles, dialogue puzzles, logic puzzles and the occasional mini-game (these can be skipped if the player doesn't like them).\n\nThere is an in-game hot spot help showing interactive items on the screen, and the cut scenes can be re-watched from the \"Bonus\" option in the menu.

      "description": "<i>Gone Home</i> is a story-driven adventure game played from a first-person perspective. It focuses on exploration and is set entirely in a single house. The protagonist is Kaitlin Greenbriar, a 20-year-old woman who returns to her parents home in the USA on 7th June 1995 after a long trip in Europe. When she arrives the house is entirely deserted with no trace of her father, mother or sister Samantha. Sam however has left a note on the door that she is gone and urging her sister not to come look for her.\n\nThe game then offers the player the ability to freely explore the rooms of the house in any order or direction. Clues are pieced together by examining items in the environment: notes, letters, bills, photographs etc. These are however not presented as puzzles, but are scattered among typical items found in a house. The core gameplay revolves around browsing through items of which most serve no direct purpose. Drawers can be opened, lights can be turned on, you can look inside a dishwasher, browse books in a library, read flyers ... Most items are typical for specific rooms, such as different types of foods in a refrigerator, but also a lot of random items such as buttons, markers, pieces of papers and more, as they are expected to be found in a typical family home. Almost every item in the environment can be examined even if there is no direct purpose. Items can be picked up and rotated freely in any direction to get a better look. Every item can be dragged around and tossed at a different location, or sometimes used in the environment such as putting a tape in a recorder to listen to music. This does not serve as a mechanism to solve puzzles however, you are rather encouraged to find as many clues as possible and then piece together the story and the events by yourself. The amount of information discovered only depends on the player's investigation and is not enforced by the game. Exploration is non-linear, but there are a few triggers through keys to locked sections to slightly guide the player.\n\nMovement is done through separate keys with the mouse to look around. Items that can be interacted with are highlighted. The second mouse button is used to zoom in. There is a basic inventory system for the few sections where Kaitlin keeps an item with her, but not as a puzzle mechanism. Certain key items trigger an audio diary of Kaitlin's sister Sam. These are afterwards stored in a separate menu for further review. There is also a map for the different rooms and floors in the house, and it is expanded when new locations are discovered. The house is largely dark and deserted, so often light sources need to be turned on to get a better look.",

      "description": "<i>Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse</i> is a classical point & click adventure. It abandons 3D graphics and direct control which were used in the two predecessors and returns to the style of the first two games. The only major technical differences are a higher resolution and that the characters are modelled instead of drawn. Like every <i>Broken Sword</i> game the plot is inspired by historical events: everything centers around the painting La Maledicci\u00f3. George Stobbart and Nicole Collard witness as a masked man steals La Maledicci\u00f3 and kills the gallery owner. Both have their motivations to solve the crime - George works for the painting's insurer, Nico is a reporter and the police are incompetent - and so they unravel a conspiracy which is somehow connected to the Gnostic Gospels.\n\nThe game uses an intelligent mouse cursor: a right click on a hotspot results in looking at the item and a left click triggers an item-specific action. Of course this is the main ingredient of the puzzles: collecting items and using them on other items in order to solve problems. On some occasions there are also logic puzzles from a zoomed-in view on an object, e.g. connecting cables of an engine in order to repair the car's horn. Another important part of the game are conversations with the various characters, some of them known from previous instalments. During the course of the game the controlled character switches between George and Nico. A help function supports players who are stuck.\n\nThe original release only included the first half of the game and the second half was patched in later. The first half is set in Paris with two trips to London. The Vita version was released as a bundle (listed here) and also with the first episode separately (listed along the Android/iOS version).\n\nRetail PlayStation 4 releases include an 8-page color prologue comic in place of the manual.",

      "description": "<i>The Wolf Among Us</i> is a five-part adventure game series based on the <i>Fables</i> comic book series by Bill Willingham. The game is canon with the comic book universe and is set in the 1980s, thirty years before the first comic book. It describes an alternate version of our world where characters of our fairy tales and fables live in a separate world known as the Homelands ruled by a tyrant known as the Adversary. There are some who have fled the world, referred to as <i>Fables</i>, who has established a colony in the human world known as Fabletown, located in Manhattan in the USA. They have to hide their presence from the humans by taking on a human form through an enchantment known as <i>glamour</i>. When Fables refuse to take it or cannot afford it, they are sent to a rural community known as The Farm. In the game the player controls Bigby Wolf, the reformed Big Bad Wolf who has now become sherriff of Fabletown. His task is to make sure the residents follow the laws. The game is filled with references and characters from famous fables such as Snow White, Beauty, Beast, Mr. Toad, Bluebeard, The Little Mermaid and Woodsman, but often with a grim attitude while most of the game has a noir, hardboiled atmosphere.\n\nOn the PC the episodes were not released separately but only as a single season pack. The Xbox 360, PS3 and iOS versions offer the first episode as a separate purchase. The other four can then be bought separately (PS3/Xbox 360) or in a pack through a season pass (Xbox 360) or Multi-Pack (iOS). There is also a free trial version available with just the first act of the first episode for the Xbox 360 and PS3. For the PS3 all five episodes are also available as a single purchase through the season pass version. Both Xbox 360 and PS3 received a compilation release afterwards bundling all episodes. For the PS Vita, PS4 and Xbox One, this is the first release of the game on the platform.\n\nEach episode consists of six chapters. The five episodes are:<ul>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 - Faith</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 2 - Smoke and Mirrors</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 3 - A Crooked Mile</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 4 - In Sheep's Clothing</li>\n<li>The Wolf Among Us: Episode 5 - Cry Wolf</li></ul>The gameplay is largely identical to The Walking Dead. The game is story-driven and incorporates decisions by the player that are carried along for the entire game. There is a certain amount of freedom in exploration and sometimes multiple paths are offered, for instance in choosing where to go next. Many objects in the environment can be examined and some can also be picked up and are stored in a separate inventory. These objects are not always necessary to solve puzzles, but can improve relationships in conversations when the object is useful. Conversations with key characters and solving small puzzles are the most important trigger to progress through the game. Many of the action sequences are shown as a cinematic or through quick-time events for the player to act quickly. When they are not performed in time, the character dies or the game chooses a different route for the events. As in <i>The Walking Dead</i>, conversation options are almost always time limited and when the player does not react in time, a decision is made automatically. Each episode ends with a sneak peek at the events in the next one and a new episode starts with a short recap.",

      "description": "<i>Goodbye Deponia</i> is the third and final part of the <i>Deponia</i> trilogy and directly continues where Chaos on Deponia ended. The player takes control over the chaotic inventor Rufus - an egocentric person with little regard for people around him - who wants to escape the garbage dump planet Deponia. He also continues his fight against the Organon authorities which want to destroy Deponia and learns more about his origins.\n\nWhile the first half of the game follows the usual structure - Rufus is in a confined area with one or two dozen screens and works on a set of goals - it changes during the second half. Rufus produces two clones of himself and then the game has a similar structure as Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle: each Rufus is in his own scenario and has to solve his own puzzles. The player can freely switch characters and, depending on the progress of the protagonists, exchange items. The puzzles include all three usual variants in point-and-click adventures: inventory based puzzles (Rufus searches the scenes, picks up items and combines them with other items in the environment or his inventory), dialogue puzzles and logic puzzles (for example a machine which needs to be repaired). Help functions include a hot spot button (shows all items and exits which Rufus can interact with) and the possibility to skip the logic puzzles.",

      "description": "<i>The Inner World</i> is a humorous point & click adventure with comic graphics. It is set in Asposia, a hollow which resides inside a universe of soil. Air is provided by three wind fountains - but now one after another stops to function and unpleasant wind creatures roam the land.\nThe player takes the role of Robert, a naive and young musician, who slides into the happenings and eventually has to save the day. During his journey he travels through Asposia; later together with the mysterious thief Laura.\n\nWhile the game is set in an bizarre world, gameplay is more traditional: Robert moves through the areas, takes items and talks a lot with other characters. The puzzles are mostly solved by using items with other items. The controls are touch optimized, even for systems with mouse controls: clicking on an object brings up a menu with options and items have to be dragged from the inventory into the world. When the player is stuck, there is a help function available which gives (gradually more explicit) hints for specific puzzles. It is also possible to highlight interactive objects.",

      "description": "Something strange happened to the protagonist Ray Doewood: an alien moved into his brain! The direct effect is that Ray is now able to read the thoughts of other people. Unfortunately The Man, a mysterious villain, also has interest in the alien and sends his lackeys to capture Ray. The goal of the game is to flee from that undesirable fate.\n\nEach level consists of a freely explorable scene in which Ray meets various humorously overdrawn people. The goal is to read their minds, find out what they desire and give it to them. Then Ray usually gets something out of it which another person desires and so on. The special gimmick is that the whole world and its inhabitants are made out of cutout paper: Ray can cut out (read: take) objects and stick it to other, predefined places in order to solve puzzles. There is also a bit of platforming involved, both in order to reach other places and to avoid The Man's men. Objects can (in some cases have to) be used in order to avoid enemies, e.g. by sticking \"sleep\" to a guard which desires rest.",

      "description": "<i>The Walking Dead: Season Two</i> continues the story of The Walking Dead and is based on the comic books (not the TV series) of the same name. Everyone becomes a zombie, called \"Walker\", after death (at least when the brain is still intact) and the series follows people in their attempts to survive. Just like the source material, the game is less about fighting zombies than showing how the survivors react to their situation and interact which each other. \n\nBesides a small intro portion, the story is set over a year after the happenings of the first game. Clementine initially travels together with Omid and Christa, but due to unfortunate circumstances she soon has to survive on her own and has to find new people to trust. The player takes the role of Clementine, but regarding gameplay - with the obvious difference that the girl is not nearly as strong as the previous protagonist Lee is more often on the defensive - the mechanics are largely unchanged compared to the predecessor. \n\nOne of the main pillars of the game is making choices: in each episode, there are many decisions to make which influence how the remainder of the game plays out; the consequences may range from small to big (e.g. the death or survival of other characters). Those decisions, including Clementine's answers in conversions, have to be made within a time limit. The game also reacts to some decisions made in the first game when a savegame is imported.\n\nSometimes Clementine has the opportunity to explore a small areal and interact with items or people in order to reach her next goal or just to learn more about the situation. Here the game uses a mix between direct movement of the character and using an cursor to choose an item to interact with: after hovering over an object, a list of possible actions (e.g. looking at, taking the item or using another item in Clementine's possession) pops up. However, in comparison to the predecessor the puzzle-solving aspect has been almost completely removed; proceeding is usually only a matter of interacting with all needed items and persons. The frequent action sequences play out in quick-time events (the player has to press respectively hammer the buttons which are displayed on the screen or click on the correct spot on the screen under time pressure); in other cases there are mini games of the same complexity to solve.\n\nOn Macintosh and Windows, the episodes were only available as full package containing all five episodes. On the release date, players gained access to <i>Episode 1: All That Remains</i> while the next episodes were provided as patches over the following months. For the later PS4 and Xbox One versions all episodes were available right away as a single package. For the PS Vita all episodes were initially released separately and later as a single package. On other platforms, the later four episodes were released separately as DLC (download content) for the first episode. The included episodes are:<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/gameId,66067/\">The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 1: All That Remains</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 2: A House Divided</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 3: In Harm's Way</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 4: Amid the Ruins</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Season Two - Episode 5: No Going Back</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Murdered: Soul Suspect</i> is a third-person adventure game with minor action and stealth elements. The game is set in Salem, Massachusetts (USA) and the protagonist is detective Ronan O'Connor, a former convict who bettered his life and joined the force. The game opens with his death. In pursuit of the Bell Killer, a serial killer who terrorizes the town, he is thrown out of a window and then dies after being shot. Instead of passing away, he turns into a ghost and meets his long dead wife Julia who tells him he is between worlds as there is something unresolved about his life. He needs to figure out who killed him and stop that person. He can move around freely in the open world environment of the town and is not hindered by physical borders, but cannot pass through obstacles that only exist in the spirit world. There are other rules, as he can only enter houses and buildings when a door or a window is open.\n\nDespite the freedom of movement the investigation needs to be done in a linear way. Starting with his own crime scene, O'Connor needs to collect different types of clues to move on to new locations and progress through the story. Each location has a number of clues to discover, but only the crucial ones need to be found. To advance, he then needs to answer questions about the scene in the form of a puzzle, built up through the clues. After guessing successfully, the game moves on, usually to a new environment. The player is allowed to make mistakes as it only leads to a lower ranking of the puzzle. Even though O'Connor can examine the environment, he is not able to interact with it directly. He has however access to a number of powers that allow him to influence people, eavesdrop on conversations, possess people directly and peek. Certain areas can only be reached by possessing a cat and sneaking inside. Possessing people does not offer direct control over them, but provides control over their senses and mind-reading. There are also side missions, not related to the story, where O'Connor needs to help out a fellow ghost move on to a next world by answering questions through gathering clues in the environment.\n\nCertain parts of the game are spent with Joy, a little teen medium he meets early on, who explains the world to him and often acts as a sarcastic sidekick. They need to work together as Joy can manipulate the environment to help him. In these stealth sections O'Connor often needs to distract people using his presence and poltergeist actions to clear the way. The other stealth actions segments are provided through encounters with demons. These roam various locations and O'Connor can execute them out by sneaking up from behind and performing a combination of keys and buttons. If they spot him however, he needs to quickly shift between ectoplasm hiding spots in the environment to stay out of their way. When performed successfully, they will stop the search and leave after a while. If O'Connor possesses a human he cannot be spotted by demons.\n\nStarting with the four initial powers, O'Connor learns new abilities throughout the game, such as teleportation across short distances, telekinesis to a limited degree, and the ability to pick up memory residue that introduces memories he can visit as if in a movie to find clues for the investigation. There are 242 optional collectibles to collect: nine sets of artifacts, and eight sets of artifacts for all the ghost stories.",

      "description": "Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28th, 1914 Germany declared the war on Russia and the whole Europe was dragged into a global conflict. Families were separated, fathers and sons killed in battles by enemy or in trenches by diseases. The game, inspired by the letters written during the Great War follows the stories of several people whose tragic destinies become intertwined as the war drags on. \n\nThe game has four playable characters. One of the many Germans deported from France, Karl is separated from his wife Marie and son Victor and forced to join the German army, while Marie's father Emile is drafted into the French army. Freddie is an American volunteer who seems to have nothing to loose, and Anna is a Belgian student looking for her father. There's also Walt the dog that will aid the characters on multiple occasions. \n\nGameplay-wise it is essentially a mix of side-scrolling adventure with a lot of puzzles and a straightforward action game. During \"adventure\" segments the player guides one of the characters though a series of obstacles using their unique abilities. The puzzles include manipulation with objects, helping out people, sneaking past guards or enemies etc. Action sequences vary from dodging enemy bombs to driving a tank amidst a heated battle.",

      "description": "<i>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</i> is a first-person perspective adventure game with a plot inspired by 20th century crime novels written by authors such as H. P. Lovecraft, Stefan Grabi\u0144ski and Algernon Blackwood. You play as detective Paul Prospero who has supernatural powers. He generally handles the tasks the police and priests won't touch. He receives letters from a boy called Ethan Carter that start out as fan mail, but soon it turns out Ethan can see things as well, and for his last case he travels to Red Creek Valley to find out what has happened to him.\n\nIt is an open world type of game that can be explored freely. There is no tutorial, HUD, journal or equipment \u2014 the order in which Prospero visits the locations can be chosen freely and generally there are no puzzles that need to be completed in a fixed order to progress. That way it is possible to start an investigation until stuck and then return to it later. There are also many optional parts.\n\nThe game combines both exploring the world and solving environmental puzzles, which mainly involve examining or finding missing pieces and then determining what the order of events was and then recreating it. Whenever something of interest is discovered, a text description appears on the screen and Prospero can use his vision to view it in the past. This leads him to new clues. The larger investigations require him to find multiple items or locations that are connected. Progress is shown through the central character or item that triggers the investigation. When enabling vision, the size of the vision circle determines how much has been found. Once all vital elements have been discovered Prospero needs to use his vision to determine the chronology. He visits the different locations or items, determines the order through a sequence of increasing numbers and then lets the vision play out. If successful, the sequence is completed and the investigation is resolved. If not, the sequence suddenly halts and the order of the chronology needs to be altered.",

      "description": "In <i>Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes</i>, the player controls the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The game is set in the late 19th century and, in contrast to the predecessors, tells not one big case but six smaller, independent ones. Three of them are original stories and two (<i>The Fate of Black Peter</i> and <i>The Abbey Grange Affair</i>) are based on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. <i>The Riddle on the Rails</i> takes the basic premise of Doyle's story <i>The Lost Train</i>, but the rest of the story is original. All cases involve Holmes investigating a murder.\n\nSolving crimes has four main components. The first part is investigating the environment: here the player controls Holmes either in first or third-person (the point & click interface of the predecessors is no longer available) and navigates him through the scenes, e.g. a garden or a mansion. When Holmes walks near something interesting, a notification pops up and after pressing a button, Holmes will make an observation or interact with the object. In some cases the game switches to first-person detail view of the object, e.g. a shelve, and the player moves a cursor in search for more hot-spots. When a smaller object is viewed in detail mode, it can be rotated. \"Finished\" hot-spots are marked and detail views are automatically exited when there is no more information to be found. Additionally there are two special viewing modes available which can be turned on when investigating the environment: instinct (allows Holmes to find small details) and imagination (Holmes recreates past events in his mind). Because those viewing modes are mandatory to find certain clues, there is a notification when they should be used.\n\nThe second component is interrogating suspects and witnesses. When entering conversation, Holmes has a number of topics to choose from. This results usually in an automatic dialogue between Holmes and the other persons, but in some cases Holmes can cut in when the person is lying. Then he is presented with a number of rebuttals and has to choose the correct one. Those are either previously collected clues or come from Holmes' deductions about the person: like in the novels, Holmes closely inspects the person's outside for conclusions about character and history. From a gameplay perspective, it is similar to the object detail view: moving a cursor over the person and clicking on hot-spots.\n\nThe third component are mini games which are frequently encountered while processing evidence or searching the environment, e.g. when opening a lock. The gameplay of those mini games have a wide range and can be puzzles, action-based or simply using things in the correct sequence. While most are short, some like creating a time-table of events can be a bit more involved. All mini games can be skipped. Additionally there are some inventory-based puzzles in which Holmes has to collect a few things to (automatically) use with another thing. \n\nThis all comes together in the fourth component: deductions. They are performed on a separate screen and lead to the resolution of the case. First there is a cluster of all clues Holmes has found so far and the player has to choose two which belong together and form a deduction, e.g. \"the victim was shot\" and \"the revolver has one bullet missing\" may lead to the deduction \"the victim was shot with the revolver\". Multiple deductions together lead to another deduction and eventually to the murderer or the next step to take in the investigation, e.g. a recreation of the crime. However, many clues can be interpreted differently and this is the player's job: choosing between two alternatives based on everything what was learned - different interpretations lead to different results. In the end, the player is free to choose the conclusion and the game does not prevent accusing the wrong suspect. However, after the case the player can optionally view if the choice was correct and jump back to the last decision. There is also always a moral choice to take which boils down to hitting the murderer with the full charge of the law or being lenient.\n\nAs the cases are independent, those choices don't have impact besides a letter or newspaper story which can be picked up during the next case. While most environments are exclusive to the case and are opened up one after another, there are two places which are visited in almost every case: Holmes' and Watson's home (used for research, processing evidence and changing Holmes' appearance) and Scotland Yard (used for interrogating arrested suspects and inspect their belongings, visit the morgue or converse with Inspector Lestrade). The player almost exclusively controls Holmes; other characters like Watson or the sniffer dog Toby are only controlled in a few sequences.",

      "description": "<i>Dreamfall Chapters</i> is a direct sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and it is the third game in the adventure game series. It was in part funded through a crowd funding campaign, and was released in five separate books over time (each divided into several chapters):<ul>\n<li>Book One: Reborn</li>\n<li>Book Two: Rebels</li>\n<li>Book Three: Realms</li>\n<li>Book Four: Revelations</li>\n<li>Book Five: Redux</li></ul>Every newly released book was patched into the same game. \n\nThe story continues from the cliffhanger of the last game, and reintroduces the playable characters of Zo\u00eb Castillo and Kian Alvane, living in the twin-worlds Stark and Arcadia respectively. Stark represents a futuristic version of the technological world we live in, while Arcadia is a parallel world where magic exists. Additionally, during the occasional interlude the player takes control of a third character, Saga, as she passes through different stages of her life. A big chunk of the action happens in the cities of Europolis (more specifically its Propast district), in Stark, which covers most of central Europe, and Marcuria, in Arcadia, which was also present in The Longest Journey and <i>Dreamfall: The Longest Journey</i>. These two main locations are open and can be explored freely until the player decides to move the story forward. Other places, such as Storytime or the House of All Worlds, are either linear or simply smaller.\n\n<i>Dreamfall Chapters</i> focuses on storytelling and pathing based on player choices. The player makes decisions that affect the fates of other characters. These choices affect the gameplay in later chapters. One of these choices affects Zo\u00eb's storyline already in the first chapter as she takes on different jobs and thus meets different characters. Unlike many other adventure games, it does not rely heavily on combining items in the inventory to solve puzzles, even though there is a small inventory system where items can be examined or used in the environment. Instead Zo\u00eb mostly needs to do errands such as bringing information or items to other characters. The game is however very dialogue-focused, and much of the information about the world is told through conversations. Characters can move around freely in the game world using direct control. The camera offers free rotation and zooming. Point-and-click is used to examine items or interact with the environment. The cursors often snaps slightly to certain elements while moving it around to help the player determine where interaction is possible. When multiple actions are available a wheel is shown where icons represent the different options. During conversations different options are shown as words. By hovering the cursor over them, Zo\u00eb provides a preview of what it represents.",

You take the role of a character named Thomas who keeps waking up from a nightmare to find out that he's still in a nightmare. In a similar style to classic adventure game, the player can explorer the worlds, interact with enemies, mainly through fleeing and hiding mechanics, and interact with the environment. The player can progress through a branching tree of nightmares to one of several possible endings. The artwork is inspired by the classic artist Edward Gorey, done mostly in black and white, with color for emphasis of objects that can be interacted with.",

      "description": "<i>P.T.</i> was a first-person survival horror game. Originally launched as a free game in a new franchise by the indie studio 7780s Studio, finishing the game reveals P.T. stands for Playable Teaser and the game is actually developed by Kojima Productions as a teaser for the then upcoming but eventually cancelled game <i>Silent Hills</i>. The section was said not to be part of the game. The game starts with the protagonist who wakes up in a dark room. A door leads into an L-shaped hallway with photos and various items. The hallway appears to loop around while a radio broadcast lets the player know a man has murdered his family and later killed himself. Through various loops of the same hallway and a few surrounding rooms, gradually various forms of paranormal activity occur, with sounds, changes in lighting, apparitions and many other types of events. \n\nThere is no combat system and the focus is entirely on exploration. There are also only puzzles in the sense that certain events can be encountered, as there is no HUD or any direct means to interact with the environment except for movement. After a certain event is triggered based on various conditions, the game ends and a trailer for <i>Silent Hills</i> is shown.",

It is the so-called Great Wave, an inexplicable chain of natural disasters, and a pandemic that turned humans into the Dissolved, infected beings whose sick bodies will eventually dissolve into blood. However, before they die their gruesome death, the Dissolved gain special cognitive powers. If Michael does not hurry, he will not be able to avoid the impending moment of 'dead synchronicity', when Time itself starts to dissolve.\n \nIt is a homage to darker, classic adventure titles, such as I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream and Sanitarium. <i>Dead Synchronicity</i> has a dystopian sci-fi scenario and uses a hand drawn 2D art style with classic point-and-click adventure gameplay elements.\n\nThe game has an abrupt and open ending since it was only the first part of a planned episodic release, with follow-ups never released due to financial failure of the first.",

      "description": "Taking place six months after the events of <i>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</i>, this game follows Komaru Naegi, the younger sister of the first game's protagonist. Komaru has just escaped from the apartment where she was imprisoned for the last year and a half, and she's emerged to find the world in shambles. She is given a special \"hacking gun\" by Byakuya Togami, a survivor of the killing game from the original entry in the series. This gun, shaped like a megaphone, is a weapon Komaru can use to combat the Monokuma robots that have been terrorizing those in the outside world. However, Komaru's escape goes awry, and she finds herself under attack by the Warriors of Hope, a group of middle schoolers who wish to kill all adults and turn their current location of Towa City into a paradise for children.\n\nKomaru forms an uneasy alliance with Toko Fukawa, a troubled girl with an intense crush on Byakuya and a murderous alternate personality called Genocide Jill. The two girls make it their goal to rescue Byakuya, who has been kidnapped by the children, and escape the city. Their journey brings them into encounters with an adult resistance group, more Monokumas, and the leader of the Warriors of Hope. Though their relationship is strained at first, Toko and Komaru eventually become close friends.\n\nPlayers mainly control Komaru, who uses her hacking gun to destroy enemies and interact with the environment. When certain conditions are met, the player can choose to control Genocide Jill, whose combat abilities are more melee-oriented. Though Jill is invincible, the player's use of her is set on a timer, and they will switch back to Komaru when that timer runs out.",

      "description": "<i>Chrysalis</i> is the first episode of the five-part <i>Life Is Strange</i> adventure series. The entire game takes place in the course of a week in October 2013. The story is told from the point of view of Maxine Caulfield, a 12th grade student who wants to make a career in photography and gets a scholarship for the fictional Blackwell Academy in Arcadia Bay, Oregon (USA). She grew up in Arcadia Bay and spent most of her childhood there until she had to move with her parents to Seattle, leaving behind her best friend Chloe. This first episode starts with a strange vision near a lighthouse, showing a tornado, and then moves on to a photography class, taught by Mark Jefferson, at the academy. This episode largely serves to establish Max as a character and to introduce the people in her class and dorm and their relationships. There are however several events and relevations that already force Max to take some tough decisions.\n\nRather than a puzzle based adventure game, it is more of an interactive drama similar to the contemporary Telltale games. Max can explore the full 3D environment freely and the focus is on interaction with other characters to shape the story and character arc. There is a free camera during exploration and cinematic camera angles during cut-scenes. While walking around characters or items of interest are highlighted in white with their name shown. By clicking relevant words or actions are shown and those can be selected. Early on in the game Max discovers she has a strange ability that allows her to rewind time at will. With a strong focus on choice and consequence, and providing or withholding information, Max often has to choose sides. She can use this ability, which is a part of the game world and not just a game mechanic, to rewind time and watch the outcome of different choices before deciding how to move on. She can also use information for different choices at the initial starting point, for instance to warn people or to anticipate actions or questions or to steal an object and then rewind them to prevent people from noticing. There is a limit to the length of rewinding as the game uses internal checkpoints at certain points, but almost any scene can be rewound, weighing the consequences as the game encourages the player to experience the <i>butterfly effect</i>. Similar to the Telltale games the player is warned when characters will remember Max' actions, when there are consequences or when new conversation options are available if time is rewound.\n\nRewinding time is shown as a spiral in the top left corner of the screen with dots for important decisions. Most of the progress is based on exploration and conversations, but there are a few minor environment based puzzles, often based on the rewind function, information from conversations, observations or using a single item that is stored automatically and does not require inventory management. There are often small, optional parts in the game, encouraging exploration to take pictures of specific situations. These are stored in a separate screen and are rewarded with achievements or trophies. Max keeps track of the events in her diary. Important documents are stored in a separate screen and there is also an overview of all the characters she meets along with a bio. Max can sit down in various locations and she will then ponder the game's events. The game has a texting system Max uses to receive messages from other characters in the game. Unlike many Telltale games there are no timed conversation options with neutral choices where you do not choose anything at all, or quick time events. At the end of each episode an overview of all the major and minor choices is shown, with percentages for all players worldwide.",

In her dream Elena sees he is snatched by a creature. She goes to the mansion to investigate herself, wearing her father's amulet, but once through the gate a ghostly creature appears and she falls down a hole.\n\nThe game consists of four chapters where Elena travels through the environment and solves puzzles to progress. She can move around and crawl. Whenever she passes something interesting a text description appears over it. She can also pick up items and store them in an inventory to solve puzzles. Conversations are displayed as text and as the story progresses Elena's thoughts are stored in a diary as well as information about the different characters stored as notes. She can activate special powers through the amulet. It glows in the presence of spirits and allows her to leave her body and explore the environment in a spirit form. This technique is used often to reach places that are otherwise inaccessible as she can fly and fits through small cracks. Glowing objects can be possessed in spirit form to manipulate them. Eventually she always needs to return to her body to progress. Along the way she meets many spirits she can talk to. The game has a linear design, but there is a large environment to explore to fit the pieces together.",

      "description": "<i>Joe Dever's Lone Wolf HD Remastered</i> is an enhanced port of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf. Unlike the episodic release of the original this release includes all four acts. Additional features added to this release include improved graphics, a gallery where you can view both concept artwork as well as 3D models and the original soundtrack as well as the digital artbook.\n\nThe game is an adaptation of the long-running gamebook series starring Lone Wolf, the last of the Kai Lords. Rather than being based on one of the existing books, the game tells a whole new chapter in the life of Lone Wolf, written in collaboration with series' creator Joe Dever.\n\nThe game takes place in the fantasy world of Magnamund, three years after the destruction of the Kai order at the hands of the Darklords (as told in the very first Lone Wolf gamebook, Flight from the Dark). The only survivor of the battle, Lone Wolf now travels the kingdom of Sommerlund to fight the forces of evil. As the game begins, the player, as Lone Wolf, arrives to the remote mining town of Rockstarn and finds the town under attack from the Darklords' minions. It is now up to the player to fend off the invading armies of monsters, save the villagers and discover if the attack against Rockstarn is part of a bigger, nastier scheme.\n\nThe game is essentially a \"video gamebook\", with some light RPG elements and inventory management. At key points in the story, the player can choose between several skills to deal with the situation, leading to branching paths. When Lone Wolf encounters enemies, the game switches to a 3D battle sequence, the combat system mixing together active time battle mechanics (hybrid of turn-based and real-time made famous by the Final Fantasy game series) and Quick Time Events.",

      "description": "<i>Game of Thrones</i> is an episodic adventure game series that consists of six installments that were released between December 2014 and October 2015. The six episodes are:<ul>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 1 - Iron From Ice</li>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 2 - The Lost Lords</li>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 3 - The Sword in the Darkness</li>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 4 - Sons of Winter</li>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 5 - A Nest of Vipers</li>\n<li>Game of Thrones: Episode 6 - The Ice Dragon</li></ul>It is based on both on the original fantasy novel series <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> and the HBO TV series adaptation. From the TV series it takes the appearance and voice acting of famous characters such as Cersei Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Ramsay Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Margaery Tyrell. It also takes place concurrently with the TV series, starting at the moment of the Red Wedding at the end of the third season and following the events just up to the start of the fifth season. It does not expand upon or contradict the TV series, as it focuses mainly on House Forrester. It is a family not yet mentioned in the TV series, but briefly mentioned in the fifth book <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>. As such it is a spin-off and does not deliberately break the canon as the book does not contain any detailed information about House Forrester, but it introduces the Forrester viewpoint for many prominent characters and events. The game is set mainly in the Wolfwood region, known for its forest and carpentry supplying the other Houses, and especially the fortress Ironrath. Other prominent locations are also present, such as King's Landing or the Wall, and many others on the continents of Westeros and Essos.\n\nThe game starts with the demise of the Starks at the Red Wedding, where Lord Gregor Forrester, a Stark bannerman, and his heir Rodrik are killed by the Freys. Gregor Forrester's squire Gared Tuttle manages to escape and returns to Ironrath. The young Ethan Forrester unexpectedly becomes the new Forrester lord and has to deal with the difficult new allegiance with Ramsay Snow, the new Warden of the North, and the invasive influence of House Whitehill. King's Landing with Cersei and Tyrion is introduced through Mira Forrester, handmaiden of Margaery. Each episode is split up in multiple storylines each with different characters to control. Gared ends up at the Wall where he meets Jon Snow. Ethan's older and exiled brother Asher is the one to travel to Mereen to find support against House Whitehill meeting Daenerys. Mira in King's Landing experiences most of the political intrigues as she is dragged into the conflict between Cersei and Margaery. Other prominent characters are Ethan's twin Talia and his little brother Ryon, Lady Forrester and her brother Malcolm Branfield. Information about the character is stored in a codex with bios, accessible from the main and pause menu.\n\nThe gameplay is typical of previous Telltale games focusing on choices and consequences. Most of the gameplay consists of conversations where the player has to choose between dialogue options. Choices are remembered and important ones are carried over across episodes, leading to branching stances for the relations with the different characters. Most of the conversation options have a time limit and if none is chosen, silence or a neutral stance is activated. For a small amount of important decisions there is no time limit. There are some sections with free movement where characters can freely explore to initiate conversations and examine the environment. Objects and characters that can be interacted with are highlighted with a white circle showing options. There are no puzzles, but in some cases it is possible to pick up items, stored on the left side of the screen, that can then be used in later situations. There are some action sequences with Quick Time Events. If these are not performed correctly or fast enough, characters can die and a part has to be replayed. Some other small interactions are also available, usually based on a dragging and holding mechanic. After completing an episode a rewind function becomes available to return to an earlier part of an episode and try new choices.\n\nThis game entry covers the full season release of the game. For PC for instance individual episodes cannot be purchased, only the full season. The PlayStation and Xbox One versions offer a full season pass for all six episodes as well as individual purchases. For Xbox 360, Android and iOS users always need to purchase the first episode and then the others individually or as season pass for episodes two to six. The Xbox One version also has this option.\n\nRetail release for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 consoles marked as <i>Season Pass Disc</i> contains first five episodes on the disc, with ability to freely download episode six, accessible from the in-game's episode listing, while the same retail release for Xbox 360 and Xbox One only contains first episode on the disc and requires the remaining five to be downloaded.",

      "description": "<i>A Knight to Remember</i> is the first installment of the five-part King's Quest: The Complete Collection episodic adventure series and a reboot/re-imagining of the classic <i>King's Quest</i> adventure franchise. It mixes sparse action elements and exploration with puzzle-solving.\n\nThe first episode starts without context as Graham climbs down a wishing well. He is there on a quest for King Edward to retrieve a magic mirror, guarded by a giant dragon, a story element that was also part of the first <i>King's Quest</i> game. It is then revealed this story is told as a flashback by an old Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn. Different stories in the past are mixed up with sections in the present where Gwendolyn is controlled. Her choices are defined by those made by the player in Graham's stories, as they are her inspiration. For instance, in this episode she fights her cousin Gart in a tournament and the way the fight develops is entirely determined through Graham's actions in the earlier stories.\n\nAfter retrieving the magic mirror another story tells how Graham first went to Daventry to become a knight. He wants to enter a tournament, but he is late and misses the Parade of Hopeful Knights and the Test of Chivalry. After helping out some people to get back inside the castle and re-taking the test, he needs to earn his entrance ticket by bringing back the eye of a hideous beast. This brings him back to the well with the dragon. He competes with aspiring knights in fights, meets many different characters sometimes with the option to help them out, and there are many exploration and action sequences, even a board game played with mechanical units. Choices and consequences are carried over between episodes and especially influence how Gwendolyn will act. Generally, there are implicitly three paths to follow: bravery, wisdom or compassion. The game ends with the fight between Gwendolyn and Gart.\n\nWhen not purchasing <i>King's Quest: The Complete Collection</i> for the whole season, this first episode acts as the base game to buy King's Quest: Season Pass (episodes 2-5) as DLC or separate episodes (PlayStation only).",

      "description": "<i>King's Quest: The Complete Collection</i> is a five-part episodic adventure series and a reboot/re-imagining of the classic <i>King's Quest</i> adventure franchise. The protagonist is Graham, the same protagonist who first appeared in the original King's Quest in 1984. The entire game is told as a flashback narrated by the old Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn, similar to the story structure of King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, set in a fantasy universe and with a humorous tone. When Graham dies in the game, he often rewinds the story a bit or remarks it was not what he did. His narration is also heard during regular gameplay, especially for descriptions of the environment. The game offers entirely new stories and characters, but they often reference the earlier games. The new stories are not told in a chronological order and they are interspersed with sections in the present that revolve around Gwendolyn.\n\nThe game environment is shown through different perspectives for each scene with scrolling parts, but the camera cannot be controlled. Visually it has a cel-shaded graphical style. The player can move Graham freely in the 3D environment. When he is close to an interesting element, this is signified through one or multiple icons in the bottom right corner of the screen. The player can choose to examine, interact or pick up. Collected items are stored in an inventory. In many locations it is possible to switch to a first-person perspective to examine the environment. The game largely focuses on the story and puzzle-solving, but there is also a large amount of exploration of the environment and action sequences with escapes and fighting. Graham often needs to run and he can also push or manipulate objects in various ways, which is more prominent than using items in the inventory. These sections are sometimes shown from a first-person perspective. There are also many cut-scenes, on-rails sequences and some Quick Time Events.\n\nThe game incorporates choices and consequences in various ways and they are carried across episodes. There are many branching dialogue options (without a timer unlike in many <i>Telltale</i> games) that lead to different outcomes. In addition, puzzles often have multiple approaches without a fixed solution. The game initially starts in a confined environment, but soon opens up with a large place to explore. The way Graham solves puzzles also has consequences, for instance by choosing to involve a specific character when this leads to a negative outcome. Generally there are three types of choices to make or paths to follow: bravery, wisdom or compassion, even though these are never mentioned explicitly. This affects the story and especially the way Gwendoline will act in the present as her grandfather's stories are the inspiration for her acts. These choices were sometimes also present in the early <i>King's Quest</i> game, for instance the way Graham could deal with the dragon in the first game.\n\nThe game consists of five chapters:\n<ul>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter I - A Knight to Remember</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter II - Rubble without a Cause</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter III - Once Upon a Climb</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter IV - Snow Place Like Home</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter V - The Good Knight</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Epilogue</li>\n</ul>\nFor the PlayStation versions each chapter can be purchased separately, with the first one acting as the base game. For the Xbox and PC versions the first chapter is available separately, but the remaining ones are bought through King's Quest: Season Pass. All platforms support the first chapter + season pass as well as this complete collection with five chapters at once, except for the Xbox 360 that does not offer a complete collection.",

      "description": "<i>Beyond Eyes</i> is a game about the 10 year-old girl Rae who lost her eyesight in a fireworks accident when she was a small child. She is traumatized from the experience and hardly ever leaves the house, preferring to sit in the garden. On a summer day a stray cat called Nani visits her and they quickly become friends. When Nani disappears one day, she decides to venture outside to find the cat.\n\nRae is controlled from a third-person perspective and most of the environment is white. As she walks around, parts of the surroundings are revealed gradually and partially in a watercolour style, similar to a picture book, as she senses them through sound, smell, touch or taste. Certain objects in the environment also change as she goes closer. She sometimes misinterprets her senses and the environment changes when she notices her mistake. For instance, what initially looks like a clothesline with pieces of clothing moving in the wind, turns out to be a scarecrow, or a tree becomes a house. Her senses are visualized as pink strokes that seem to search the environment. Dangerous objects and animals have dark strokes surrounding them. When she is scared, her posture changes, the colours become dark and threatening music starts to play.\n\nThe game focuses on exploration and does not contain any puzzles or fail states. Players mainly need to guide Rae in the correct direction, opening gates or finding a path to progress, watching objects. Sometimes a dark wall of clouds appears and Rae has to find a way through or around. Events are often triggered automatically when she encounters something new.",

      "description": "<i>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</i> is a first-person adventure game set in the fictional Yaughton Valley in the British Shropshire countryside. The game starts on 6th June 1984 at the moment the world ends. It is set in an open world environment and has a non-linear story told through six characters (Frank, Jeremy, Kate, Lizzie, Stephen, Wendy) tied to specific landmarks. The protagonist is not defined, but can move around freely in the environment including a main village, woods and many other buildings. There are five main areas to the game and the focus is on unraveling the story, getting to know the characters and their relationships, and piecing together the information  to form a coherent narrative.\n\nThe entire environment is abandoned and devoid of life. Information is gathered through observation, reading notes, listening to recordings etc. At certain points swirls of golden lights appear that can be tuned like a radio using the controller's gyroscope function. By making the light brighter conversations and interactions from the past are triggered, but only through audio. Some of these lights also guide the protagonist in a certain direction. There is no HUD, inventory or puzzle-solving. No pointers are provided for noticing certain clues or reaching certain goals. Interaction is available in various ways, from manipulating items in the environment to opening doors.",

      "description": "<i>Until Dawn</i> is a horror-survival with an emphasis on both horror and survival equally enough. It borrows the gameplay elements from other movie-like games which let your choices branch the story and change what happens, such as Heavy Rain (2010), and story elements from horror teen slasher movies like \"Scream\" (1996).\n\nThe story opens at the mountain cabin as a couple of friends pulled the prank on Hannah during her rather intimate moment. Embarrassed and angry, she storms out into the snow and heads toward the woods. Finding about what happened, her-twin sister, Beth, rushes after her in order to find her. She does so, only to find out there's someone else with them. The mysterious figure catches up and what happens next is up to the player. Bodies of Beth and Hannah were never found and are presumed missing. The police never closed the case.\n\nFast forward to a year after this incident, eight friends decide to come to the same mountain cabin for a reunion at Josh's request. Josh being the brother who lost his two sisters, and a close friend, the rest of them were in no position to refuse his invitation. In memory or Hannah and Beth, to catch up with one another, and possibly enjoy the romantic retreat in the mountains. What starts with good intentions, soon ends in screams, bloodshed and impossible choices as the eights of them fight for survival again someone or something.\n\nThe story switches from one character to another, making the player control most of them as the story progresses, very often being accompanied by another character, depending on the situation. During the gameplay, the player can use time to explore around and look for clues, or just remain ignorant and forward the story. Everything has consequences, and looking for clues will keep you more informed and in turn increase your chances for survival. Clues that can be found are tied to three things in particular... the twin sisters Hannah and Beth, the incident that occurred in 1952, and the mysterious man that might be somewhere on the mountain with all of you.\n\nBy picking up objects and clues, you can rotate them for more detailed view, much like it was done in L.A. Noire (2011). Additionally, there are pieces of totem poles scattered around that give you a short vision of possible things to come and serve as a warning. Totem poles are split into five categories... those that show your death, those that try to guide you, those that show a loss of your friend, those that prompt you to a danger, and the fortune telling ones. By collecting the totems, you unlock the excerpts from a video that tells about the events from the past. Video can be watched incomplete as well, it will just skip to unlocked parts of the full presentation.\n\nThe game choices are presented in a form of a butterfly effect. Your choices, your decisions or indecisiveness, they will shape the story and constantly branch it toward one of the many different paths and conclusions. You can review the list of your choices and see your butterfly effect from the main menu, showing the key choices you have done throughout the game and what they in turn instigated. At any point during gameplay, you can check your character traits which are also defined by your choices. Things like honesty, bravery, curiosity, and such. Additionally, you can see the affection bar between your current character and the rest of the protagonists.\n\nAside from Hannah and Beth in the prologue, protagonists in the game feature these eight people:\n<ul>\n<li> Ashley - inquisitive and academic, a good friend with Chris\n<li> Chris - humorous and methodical, a good friend with Ashley\n<li> Emily - Mike's ex, currently dating Matt\n<li> Jessica - Mike's girlfriend, doesn't get along with Emily\n<li> Josh - the brother of Beth and Hannah\n<li> Matt - Emily's boyfriend\n<li> Mike - Emily's ex, currently dating Jessica\n<li> Sam - the one who tried to warn Hannah about the prank\n</ul>",

      "description": "<i>The Order of the Stone</i> is the first episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, a five-part adventure series based on the sandbox building and exploration game Minecraft. Typical for Telltale games, it is a cinematic adventure where the story is driven through the player's choices. Decisions are carried over and influence characters and events. The game uses the original title's block design and introduces a story for the game world as there was none for the original title. At the start of the game the player can choose between six characters, three male and three female, with different appearances.\n\nThe introduction explains the title as the The Order of the Stone is a legend of four heroes who once defeated the Ender Dragon. The game then returns to the present where the character Jesse (either male or female) is the protagonist. His friends Olivia and Axel are introduced, along with Jesse's pet pig Reuben. Axel brings the news of the Endercon where there will be a building competition with a chance for the winner to meet Gabriel, one of the heroes of The Order of the Stone. They build a giant Creeper, but a rival team known as The Ocelots tries to sabotage it, accidentally setting Reuben on fire. The pig flees into the woods and the friends venture there to find him back. He has to fight mobs and is helped by Petra, who tells him about a wither skull from the Nether she intends to trade for a diamond. Back at Endercon the competition can be won or lost, and the deal with the diamond becomes shady. Through a number of events Jesse, Olivia, Axel and the new characters Lukas and Ivor arrive in the Nether through a portal with no immediate way back. Using a mine cart they eventually arrive in the Overworld and more about the history of the order is revealed. At the end of the episode Jesse has to choose which of the heroes to track down first, by choosing between Axel or Olivia.\n\nAs the story unfolds, there are different moments where the characters is offered different choices for actions or conversations. These are time limited and if none is chosen, the 'silence' option is selected automatically, which also counts as a decision. Choices are remembered by characters, with a notice for the player, and influence how they will react in the future. Unlike other Telltale titles however, the tone is lighter and less mature, and many choices do not have the strong emotional impact other games by the developer are known for. There are many humorous moments and references to typical <i>Minecraft</i> elements. Next to the cut-scene-like gameplay there are moments with free exploration. Jesse then can freely explore the environment, collect items in an inventory and solve small puzzles. There are quick time events and also action sections where he fights mobs in the woods and on a bridge using his sword. He can move between a number of lanes, strike with the sword and has a limited amount of health. There are also sections where Jesse gets to create a new sword and a bow and arrows by arranging various items in a way according to a recipe similar to how it is done in the original <i>Minecraft</i>. At the end of the episode an overview of the choices is shown, compared to those of players worldwide.\n\nThis game entry only covers the platforms where the first episode of the game is available separately, unlike the PC version. Additional episodes could be purchased as a season pass or as additional single DLC items or in-app purchases for this first episode as the base entry, depending on the platform. For some platforms listed here the entire season can also be bought right away, as a single purchase.",

      "description": "<i>Zer0 Sum</i> is the first episode of Tales from the Borderlands, a five-part episodic adventure series based on the universe of the <i>Borderlands</i> first-person shooter titles. The game is set in the world of Pandora where the Borderlands is a dangerous region where advanced alien technology is stored in vaults. It draws the attention of hunters who travel there to raid the vaults and acquire the technology. The introduction mentions Handsome Jack and his Hyperion faction of pirates, but then starts in medias res.\n\nThe game opens with the character Rhys in a desert. He is looking for someone called Fiona, but is captured by a man interested in the Gortys project. It turns out he has captured Fiona as well and the entire game is then told as flashbacks, alternating between Rhys and Fiona, to explain how they got up to that point. In the first extensive flashback Rhys is introduced. He is a company man working for Handsome Jack's Hyperion. Rhys is about to get a promotion, but finds out his boss Henderson has been murdered and is replaced by his nemesis Vasquez. He is promptly demoted Senior Vice Janitor. He overhears a shady deal of Vazquez and involves his friends Yvette and Vaughn to obtain the vault key Vasquez is after. They travel to Pandora carrying Hyperion funds to make the deal, but quickly become involved with bandits and then the people who want to trade the key for money.\n\nThe second flashback introduces Fiona. She is a con artist born and raised on Pandora with her sister Sasha. Together with their mentor and surrogate father Felix they devise elaborate scams. They try to sell a fake vault key, which is what eventually brings Rhys and Fiona together. She uses a false identity as an archaeologist to gain the trust of August, who has a good reputation to interest Vazquez at Hyperion. The meeting between the two parties is eventually crashed by a fight between the two characters Bossanova and Zer0. Bossanova gets away with the money and the parties of Rhys and Fiona reluctantly team up to sneak inside Bossanova's facility to retrieve the money. The game then splits up for two pairs of characters who taken different routes. Rhys and Sasha try to enter the underground, while Fiona and Vaughn discover the briefcase has become a prize in a death race. The episode ends in the present with the captured protagonists at the moment of the flashback when they find out about the Gortys project.\n\nThe game uses the same cel-shaded visual style as the original <i>Borderlands</i> games. Similar to other Telltale adventure series, the game is story driven and largely cinematic. The player can influence and steer the story through dialogue options that have a time limit. If time runs out, silence or the neutral option is chosen automatically. Choices are carried over and influence the story and the relationships with other characters. The game has many humorous moments and lighter themes than other Telltale games. There are short quick time events for fights and some other actions where prompts need to be followed. For certain scenes there is complete freedom of movement to walk around, examine and talk to other characters. There are also minor puzzle-solving elements. Fiona can collect money hidden in the environment, stored in her bank account. A sufficient amount of money can be used as an additional option in some situations, for instance to bribe a bouncer or to buy a better helmet for the death race. As control over the characters alternates often quickly in succession, and they often bend the truth their way, the player has to adapt quickly between their mindsets as they can cause each other trouble by constantly pursuing their own interests.\n\nFor all platforms listed here this first episode is available separately (unlike the PC version) and is entirely free. The remaining four episodes can be purchased as single episodes or as episode packs, depending on the platform, with this first episode as the base game.",

      "description": "The Swedish game studio Frictional Games continues its tradition in the horror genre (Amnesia, Penumbra series) with <i>SOMA</i>. This time, the player is presented with a science fiction story in which the protagonist, Simon Jarret, is suddenly transported to an abandoned facility the moment he goes through a brain scan. After surviving a car accident with severe brain injuries as a result, Simon accepts to have his brain scanned with a new, experimental technology. While he starts the day in his apartment in Toronto, the scan takes him to the mysterious PATHOS-II facility mere hours later.\n\nMuch like its predecessors, <i>SOMA's</i> gameplay is built from monster encounters, puzzle solving and the exploration of mysterious game world and plot. Similar to <i>Amnesia</i> or the last two <i>Penumbra</i> games, Simon in unarmed and every encounter requires the player to avoid direct contact with the hostile creatures of PATHOS-II. As for the puzzles, Frictional reuses in part the capabilities of its in-house engine, the HPL engine (on its third main version), to manipulate every object in the world as if the mouse were a virtual hand that the player inserts in the game world. However, this time around puzzles are mainly about interacting with computer terminals, leaving object manipulation more for world exploration.",

      "description": "<i>Oxenfree</i> is an adventure game with supernatural elements set on Edwards Island, an old military island. Five teenagers travel there by boat to hang out and spend the weekend. The blue-haired Alex is the main protagonist and she is a good friend of Ren, a talkative stoner. She brings along Jonas, her new stepbrother who does not yet know much about Alex. Joining them is Mona, Ren's crush, and the cynical Clarissa. Clarissa used to date Michael, Alex's brother who passed away, and they do not get along. The island has a few shops for tourists, but only the old Mrs Adler lives there. There are however still many buildings from a long time ago. The game starts as a lazy evening at the beach with a campfire. Ren talks about strange phenomena that occur in a nearby cave and that triggers an event that takes the teenagers to locations all over the island.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person side view with side-scrolling environments. Alex can be moved around freely and a single button is used to climb or jump gaps, but only to continue moving as there are no platform elements. She is the main character and controlled by the player, while the other characters generally follow her. Most of the attention goes to character development, conversations and the relationships between the characters. The game uses a free-flowing conversation system where the characters talk to each other and Alex can intervene, often by choosing from three options. Each option has a different colour that represent a certain emotion. These fade after a short time, so the player chooses one of the options and can also determine when to cut off someone. Remaining silent and not weighing in is also an option. Alex's choices influence how the other characters think about her, how they feel towards each other and what type of options will be available for later conversations. A small text balloon showing a character's face often signals this to the player. Based on the choices, different routes, actions and companions can be chosen, also leading to different endings.\n\nThe game's focus is on progressing the story and there is only a small amount of puzzle elements. These are solved by using Alex's portable radio, which can be activated at any time. By adjusting the frequency she can listen to conversations and music, as well as a tourist guide for interesting locations on the island. There are however also locations with red frequencies. These often trigger supernatural events involving the island's history with horror elements, often including audio and video distortions and glitches. Solving a puzzle is usually done by finding the right frequencies. Another type of puzzle involves finding the correct speed for audio tapes. It is not possible to die or get stuck, but many choices are irreversible. After the initial events the goal is to bring all the teens back together, unravel the island's history and explain the strange occurrences, and find a way off the island.\n\nThere are two types of optional collectibles. Seven photographs can be collected based on triggering certain events and after requiring the advanced radio twelve buried letters can be discovered by tuning the radio to a specific frequency at a specific location. There also several anomalies that can be tracked for additional information, but are not mandatory.\n\nWith the Playstation 4 release a simultaneous update is made with the Xbox One and the PC version. The option to continue the game anew with \"New Game +\" mode is added to the main menu, which will visible after finishing the game. New dialogues, settings, conclusions and earlier feeling of deja-vu will be triggered, throughout the New Game+.",

      "description": "<i>Firewatch</i> is a narrative-driven game played from a first-person perspective and set in 1989. The protagonist is Henry, a man in his forties, who takes on the solitary job of manning a firewatch lookout in the secluded wilderness of Two Forks Lookout Area in Wyoming. However, the game starts fourteen years earlier, in Boulder, Colorado, in 1975. The first minutes of the game are largely text-based and explain how Henry met his wife Julia and what led him to the job on his own many years later. The player can choose between different responses to help shape Henry's background.\n\nThe game takes place over the course of about 79 days, but only a small amount of days are an actual part of the game. The Two Forks Lookout is Henry's home and the place where most days start. Almost all conversations in the game are done using a portable radio with his supervisor Delilah who is also in a tower, Thorofare Lookout, a mountain over. When she talks to Henry, there are often multiple answers to choose from that shape their relationship. The player chooses to have Henry divulge much of his personal life and react affectionately towards her, or keeps it neutral. The choices often influence how she will react in the future. At the same time, not replying or using silence is almost always an option and also leads to a different effect. A small vertical bar shows the amount of time left before 'silence' is chosen as an option. In return, almost any object or event can be used as a basis to talk to Delilah through a radio icon, but it always up to the player to initiate such a conversation or to have Henry keep it to himself.\n\nAlmost right away the entire game world can be explored freely. Henry carries a map that shows his current position, along with the important paths and locations, and he also uses a compass. There are several cache boxes with items and smaller maps that can be used to update Henry's map. Many items, in the tower and outside, are interactive. Even though there is no inventory or puzzles to solve, except for locating certain people or items using the map, many things can be picked up and examined closely, or be thrown away. It is also possible to zoom, both using the map and in the game world. Henry can run, remove certain overgrowth to clear a path, move over obstacles, jump down, and use ropes to rappel. Even though there is free exploration, the game itself is entirely linear based on a series of tasks and sudden occurrences. Henry can nevertheless handle them or react to them in many different ways, shaping his character. Delilah generally steers Henry in the right direction, but there are also often audiovisual clues in the environment. Smaller interactive elements are most often not indicated and it is up to the player to discover them. Most of the gameplay is based on exploration and the conversations with Delilah.",

Both versions of the game are available separately in the game library. The new version also introduces French, German, Spanish, Italian and Polish subtitles.

      "description": "<i>The Park</i> is a first-person psychological horror game set in the same universe as the MMORPG The Secret World by the same developer. It starts in the parking lot of the Atlantic Island Park just after closing time and it is played from the perspective of a woman called Lorraine. Her son Callum is waiting in the car and when she walks up to the ticket office, Callum runs past her into the park, so the attendant lets her in to fetch her son. Lorraine gets to explore the park at the moment it is already almost dark. It quickly becomes a very different location when more of the background story is revealed.\n\nThere is free movement, but generally only a linear path to follow. The game focuses on letting the player experience the story and there are no action or puzzle elements. Lorraine can optionally interact with certain items such as objects, letters and books to examine them. In certain cases it is also possible to rotate the objects. This is not mandatory, but often reveals more of the circumstances. The same goes for going on certain rides. At other times Lorraine narrates a part of her life story herself. The right mouse button is used to call Callum. He responds, usually running off in the distance, and often it is a way to follow a path to a next event. A separate button is used to toggle running instead of walking.\n\nThe game has horror elements and a number of scares that later on take on a more psychological nature. An evil force is present in the park and Lorraine fears it is after her son. During the course of the story much is revealed about Lorraine's life and her son, her link to the park, the history of the park and its owner, and how the community reacted to it. The game can generally be completed in less than two hours.",

      "description": "<i>The Walking Dead: Michonne</i> is an episodic adventure game in the series of Telltale adaptations of the <i>The Walking Dead</i> comic series. It is centered around the female character Michonne and it takes place between issues 129 and the 139 of the comic books series. Michonne temporarily departs from the group of survivors led by Rick Grimes during the zombie apocalypse and this game shows what happened to her during the time she way away. None of the game's events are part of the comic book series.\n\nThe game consists of three episodes released over time:<ul>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode Two of Three: Give No Shelter</li>\n<li>The Walking Dead: Michonne - Season Finale: What We Deserve</li></ul>For PC, all three episodes need to be bought as a single purchase and they are not available separately. For the other platforms there are options to buy the three episodes at once, each episode separately (with the first one serving as the base game for the others), or episode two and three in a single purchase.\n\nMost of the mechanics of the previous Telltale games return. It is largely story-driven with many long sequences. Interaction is limited to three areas. There are choices during conversations that influence the direction of the story and the relationships between the characters. There are often three to four options and characters will behave differently based on the chosen answer. A timer counts down and not answering is also an option. At the end of each episode an overview of the important choices is shown, compared to players worldwide. There are also many quick time events, fleeing from walkers or fighting. These require a quick response or someone dies and the section has to be replayed. The final form of interaction is short sequences with freedom of movement to explore and examine the environment. Sometimes small puzzles need to be solved to progress and certain items can be stored in an inventory. Visually the game uses the same cel shaded style from the previous <i>The Walking Dead</i> games.\n\nThe game starts in the woods, with a staggering Michonne fighting walkers interspersed with flashbacks of how she abandoned her daughters. Just before she is about to commit suicide, she is rescued by a group who takes her aboard their boat. That entire sequence then turns out to be another flashback and the game then starts aboard the boat three weeks later, when Michonne is already an established member of the group and familiar with everyone. They pick up a radio signal of what may be Rashid and Vanessa, two friends of Pete, one of the group members. When he and Michonne head out in a small boat to investigate, they are attacked by walkers and have to board the ferry where the two friends are about to reside. The game then introduces many different characters at once, of different groups, and important choices about allegiances have to be made.",

      "description": "<i>The Fall</i> is the first game in a trilogy where the protagonist is artificial intelligence called A.R.I.D. It is part of a high-tech combat suit worn by a character called Colonel Josephs and uses a female voice. It activates itself after crashing on an unknown planet and since the user of the suit does not respond, her routines immediately kick in, and she seeks medical attention to save the pilot. Since the AI has full access to the suit functions, she can take over control. The game is played in a 2D side-scrolling environment. The suit can be moved left or right and it can jump as well. The environment can be examined using a flash light where the beam can be guided in any direction. It highlights interactive parts of the world, which can then be interacted with. Interactions include conversations with multiple dialog options, interacting with computers and tools, examining the environment and picking up objects.\n\nThe majority of the game plays like a classic adventure game. Through careful observation puzzles need to be solved. Items are stored in an inventory. They do not need to be combined, but are used in the environment to progress. Through conversation options, often with computer systems, progress can be achieved that way as well. There is also a very different side of the game, played with action elements for several parts. Initially ARID is restricted through her own routines, but by bringing her pilot in dangerous situations, emergency routines can be triggered permanently, opening up the options to use and upgrade a gun, activate camouflage and so on. In these sequences robots need to be fought, using cover in the environment and timing attacks carefully. Just like the flash light the gun can be aimed in any direction. There is a shield that regenerates over time and a limited amount of life support (health). It is possible to die and then the game returns to an earlier checkpoint. These action sequences are mandatory and require quick reflexes to complete. There is an amount of stealth as well. Once the camouflage option is activated it is possible to hide in the environment and unaware enemies can be taken out from behind.\n\nMost of the game however is based around puzzle-solving. It is story-driven and often focuses on how ARID struggles with her internal instructions combined with the directive to save the pilot. In some situations this shows her inability for nuance or lies. A Caretaker who now controls the facility sees her as faulty and aims to refurbish her. A large part of the game for instance shows how ARID needs to pass tests in unique ways to show her proficiency as a household robot, to show her willingness to comply. There are also many other dangers next to the Caretaker, such as security robots, fish, slugs and poisonous fungi. Much of the story and the facility's background is revealed through notes and conversations with computer systems.",

      "description": "Similar to Grim Fandango: Remastered, <i>Day of the Tentacle: Remastered</i> is a remastered version of the classic point-and-click adventure game Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle from 1993. The content and gameplay are entirely identical to the original game. The largest difference is that the entire game was redrawn in high resolution art, for both the characters and the backgrounds. Just like in <i>Grim Fandango: Remastered</i> it is possible to switch between the original and the new art at any moment while playing.\n\nEach version also has a different interface. The original version shows the possible verbs and the inventory at the bottom, and the description of items in the environment when hovering above them appear there as well. In the remastered version there is no bottom part and the environment takes up the entire screen. Descriptions of items in the environment appear directly next to the cursor. Right clicking on an item opens up a contextual graphical verb wheel where the most common verbs for the item are displayed. It is however still possible to scroll and select a less relevant verb and then click on an item to see the response.\n\nThe audio was reworked to make the voices clearer, the soundtrack was redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system, and there is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators. Just like in the original game the full version of the first title Maniac Mansion can be unlocked and played in-game, but this game-in-a-game was not remastered.",

      "description": "<i>Galgun: Double Peace</i> is a non-lethal rail-shooter that expands and upgrades on the Galgun game originally released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The story follows Houdai Kudoki, a sophomore boy who got accidentally shot by none other than Cupid. The side effect is that all the girls in the campus find him irresistible, and with every girl confessing her love for him, he is having trouble finding his true love until the effect wears off. While trying to profess his love to one of the heroines, Houdai finds himself being constantly chased by schoolgirls professing their love to him, either in written or screaming statements. There is no way to escape them, but you can fire pheromone projectiles at them which will give them ecstasy and create a passage for you to go through. During gameplay, the player can also use perspective zoom which aside from zooming can display through certain objects (e.g. you can see girl's bra through her t-shirt). For certain girls the action scene kicks in which lets you get more intimate as the camera is circling around the girl who is crazy for you, and you can only appease her appetite by touching or rubbing her... through the PlayStation Vita's touch screen feature, of course.",

      "description": "<i>The End of Peace</i> is the first episode of Blues and Bullets, an episodic noir thriller series where the player take control of the real character Elliot Ness, the American Prohibition agent and legendary leader of the law enforcement team nicknamed The Untouchables. It is a cinematic adventure game modeled after the Telltale games, where most of the gameplay is experienced through cinematic sequences, with dialogue options, small portions with free moment, some puzzle-solving elements, and action sequences with shooting or prompts for quick time events. The game emphasizes the investigation mechanics, as the player needs to analyze scenarios, find clues and talk with other characters. As a homage to classic noir film genre, the game is monochromatic with sparse dashes of red.\n\nWhile the protagonist is based on a real person, the story itself is entirely fictitious and takes place in an alternate history where Ness has left the force and now runs a small restaurant name called Blues and Bullets in the city of Santa Esperanza. The episode consists of five chapters with thirteen scenes that take place in different time periods and are experienced in a non-chronological order. The game opens showing a dungeon where several children are locked up and the player gets to control a little girl. In the present Ness is approached by Al Capone, who still lives, to investigate the childrens' disappearances to bring back his granddaughter Sofia. There are also flashbacks to twenty years earlier, showing how Ness clashed with Capone, how the gangster got away and how Ness came to leave the force.\n\nThere are several sequences with free moment and instead of choosing between full dialogue lines, the player often needs to choose an emotion represented through a single word, from multiple options, to steer the conversation in a certain direction. Often there is a time limit before a neutral option or silence is selected automatically. While walking around red eye icons signal parts of the environment where interaction or examination is possible. It is possible to Ness to die, especially during quick time events, but also during sequences with free movement where he needs to hop between cover and aim and shoot enemies.\n\nEach episode has several important choices that shape Ness's character and steer the story with permanent consequences. This choices can be reviewed and are compared worldwide in a separate menu. In a late part of the episode, there is a scene at the house of a character called Boccherini with very different gameplay. There Ness has to piece together what has happened by examining and linking clues. Clues are reviewed in the environment and are then linked on a giant board that represents his mental thought process. Only by making correct corrections does it become possible to progress. While viewing objects up close they can be rotated to reveal additional information.\n \nThis is the first of five episodes released over time. After completing the episode a brief preview of the next one is provided through audio. It also unlocks a bubble head mode for the game. The remaining four episodes can be bought separately, as small bundles of episodes or as a single season pass as Blues and Bullets: Season Pass, in both cases as DLC. All five episodes can also be bought right away as a single purchase.",

      "description": "<i>1979 Revolution: Black Friday</i> is a cinematic adventure game set around 1979 during the Iranian Revolution. The protagonist is Reza Shirazi, a photojournalist, who is in Tehran during the uprising against the Shah's regime. The game consists of 19 chapters of varying length, historically accurate under the documentary-style banner V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Games, and based on the real events and eyewitness testimonies. The frame story takes place in April 1980 at Evin Prison where Reza is locked up and interrogated by Assadollah Lajevardi. The conversation leads to many flashbacks as the main interactive sequences where most of the story is explained.\n\nThe civil resistance against the Western-backed Pahlavi dynasty of the Shah brings together many different groups, both religious and secular, and the player's choices shape whom Reza will support. His best friend Babak follows the peaceful protest of the Islamic group led by Khomeini, while his cousin Ali Shirazi urges him to protest violently and fight against the military supporting the Shah. Bibi Golestan and Abbas, part of the civil resistance, ask his help to document the revolution with his photographs. At the same time he needs to keep in mind that his brother Hossein is a member of SAVAK, the Shah's intelligence service, and his parents want to keep the family together.\n\nThe game mechanics closely resemble those of the Telltale cinematic adventure games. Most of the game is told through cut-scene sequences, with (timed) dialog choices that are remembered, and those influence events and how characters will interact with Reza. There are also some action sequences with quick time events. If the prompts are missed, Reza can get killed and then that part needs to be restarted. There are several sections where Reza can walk around freely, exploring the environment. During these it is possible to interact with items and these are most often stored as stories in a separate screen where most of the events, history and cultural traditions are explained.\n\nAs a photojournalist he also regularly needs to take photos. At certain moments an icon signals that a photo can be taken and then the environment can be scanned through the lens, looking for an interesting event. This turns a marker green. The player then has to time a marker on a bar moving left and right to take the picture at the correct moment to make sure it is sharp with good focus. At certain points smaller interactions are also supported, such as looking for clues in photos, developing film, searching environments, treating a wounded man and so on. Next to the stories based on experiences in the game, photos are also stored in a separate screen.",

      "description": "<i>Kholat</i> is a survival horror video game. It is based on the <i>Dyatlov Pass incident</i>, where a group of nine Russian college students went missing in February 1959 on Kholat Syakhl (\"Dead Mountain\") and were found dead in the time span of four months. The tenth student walked back earlier due to illness. The player controls the protagonist who is retracing the steps of the students. \n\nThe game consists of three main acts in which the player has to eventually reach the scene of the Dyatlov Pass incident. By use of a map and compass system, the mountain pass has to be explored, using basic movements as walking and sprinting. Jumping nor climbing is possible. The sprinting is limited, with excessive use leading to motion impairment and vision blurring. The sprint is mostly used to escape to safety after the brief encounters you have with the mountain\u2019s hostile \u201cfire spirits\u201d. Failure to escape from a \"fire spirit\", stepping into a trap or falling of ledges will result in an instant death. The game has limiting abilities to save your game, only when you\u2019re visiting one of the established camp sites strewn around the pass or whenever you find a new note, article or journal page strewn across the mountain pass.",

      "description": "<i>The Town of Light</i> is a psychological adventure game. It is set in a real location, the Ospedale Psichiatrico di Volterra psychiatric hospital in Tuscany, Italy. The protagonist is Ren\u00e9e who was an inmate at the institution starting in 1938 at the age of sixteen. The hospital she explores in 2016 is abandoned and in ruins, but the location triggers interactive flashbacks so time is constantly switched between present and past as moments are relived. At the same she is an unreliable narrator with a confused viewpoint due to her mental illness and hallucinations, so a lot is left for the player to interpret. Ren\u00e9e is not based on a real character, but the game incorporates many elements of the treatment that were common there at the time. There is a lot of suspense in the game, due to the ambience and the events, but there are no horror elements such as jump scares, monsters, supernatural themes or fail state situations. However, the themes and often disturbing events make this game exclusively intended for adult users, as stated by the developers.\n\nRen\u00e9e can freely explore the once self-sustained hospital and surroundings using a first-person perspective. In the early parts of the game some wards are still locked, but eventually everything can be explored. Ren\u00e9e can interact with the environment to open and close doors and windows, and interacts with parts of the scenery. There is no inventory system, even though a single object can sometimes be carried in her hands for a short time. Many objects can be picked up and examined from up close, allowing the player to rotate and zoom freely. In dark environments a flashlight can be activated with an infinite battery.\n\nThe story is largely linear, but with a few twists. Based on the experiences while exploring three types of elements are stored in a synopsi menu that can be accessed at any time: Experience (a written account), Memories (short flashbacks) and Medical Records (documents that can be consulted). At certain points Ren\u00e9e needs to make choices, but only in the sense that the player needs to tell her how to interpret events. You can for instance side with the hospital and the workers, assuring Ren\u00e9e they have the best interest at heart, or you can encourage her to push through with what her intuition tells her, even when she has problems discerning reality. Through documents, flashback and events much of her background and life story is eventually revealed.\n\nThe game consists of fifteen chapters, with the start of each chapter acting as a checkpoint and the only save system in the game. Based on certain choices the story branches a first time with the start of chapter six and then once more for chapter twelve, until everything comes together again at the end. These branching stories introduce new events and different approaches to situations and interpretations. Through the chapter system, which allows the player to revisit earlier ones quickly, the player is encouraged to replay and experience the full story. Completed branches are coloured in and there are colour hints that show where the chosen direction is leading. Next to that, there are also a number of optional discoveries and events in the environment. The branches, presented visually as a communication model with four variations, are tied to specific disorders that can be pursued.\n\nThe small amount of puzzles are usually environment based. Often the player needs to interpret hints as to understand what to do or where to go. There are many different rooms and a map hanging in the entrance can be used for orientation. When stuck, Ren\u00e9e will sometimes repeat her intentions and optionally a hint can be used. Sometimes there are also audio cues to steer the player in the right direction, but apart from that there is no help or on-screen assistance. From the main menu an interactive diary can be accessed where Ren\u00e9e explains most of her childhood as she experienced it, in written form.",

      "description": "Alex Oshima is the commander of a space station. Or at least she was until some unknown disaster destroyed it, erased her memory and presumably killed everyone else. Now her goal is simple: escaping the station by reaching and activating a rescue vessel.\n\n<i>ADR1FT</i> follows the style of Gone Home and focuses on exploring the space station and finding items like audio logs, e-mails or memorabilia which help finding out more about the station and the people within. Progression through the station is linear and Oshima always needs to activate some computer or switch in order to open up the next section. There are no puzzle elements and the next goal is marked on the mini-map. Sometimes the way also leads outside.\n\nThe game's speciality is the zero gravity state: Instead of walking, Oshima floats through the levels. This has obvious implications for the movement options (the player has to think in six axis instead of four) and also is the main argument for the optional virtual reality component. The problem is that this may opens up the danger if bumping into things - which further damages the already holey space shoot: Oshima loses air with every move (being moved by the momentum after using the suit's thrusters does not count as movement) and when it runs out, the player needs to continue from the last checkpoint. Thankfully there are frequent air dispensers and air bottles for one-time use which fill up the air level. During the course of the game, Oshima will find terminals which upgrade her suit to hold more air and sustain more damage.\n\nAfter beating a section, it can be replayed separately without time pressure.",

      "description": "<i>Agatha Christie: The ABC Murders</i> is based on the novel of the same name. The main character is the master detective Hercule Poirot who, together with his assistant Hastings, investigates the ABC murder mystery: A serial killer who bases his murders on the alphabet (and likes to send taunting letters to Poirot) is on the loose. In contrast to other Agatha Christie works, this story is set in a number of English locations and not in a confined environment. Except for the inspiration, this game is unrelated to the Nintendo DS game of the same name.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent with investigating crime scenes and other locations: searching for and clicking on hot spots and finding clues. Often the game goes in a close-up view and shots the number of hot-spots to find in said view. When observing people or places, the player needs to find spots which correspond with Poirot's statement (for example, when he says \"This woman is a heavy smoker\", the cursor needs to be held over a cigarette). During conversations, the player needs to choose the stay in character for information and bonus points - but the game continues even after botching an interrogation completely.\n\nSometimes during the case, Poirot enters deduction mode which works similar as in Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes: in a mind-map, the player needs to combine the collected evidence to form conclusions. However, in contrast to <i>Crimes and Punishment</i> there is no option to fail. A similar mechanic are the reconstructions where the detectives reconstructs a timeline. It is basically a movie and at certain points the player needs to choose how it continues - if a wrong answer is chosen, it is back to the beginning. \n\nAdditionally the game features a number of logic puzzles which take place on a separate screen. Those are mostly a simpler version of The Room: the examined object can be turned around by holding the button and the player can manipulate certain areas. For example, a part may be loose, can be moved and reveals a button which in turn reveals another part of the contraption. There are also some traditional puzzles like comparing two letters to see if the same typewriter was used. There are no traditional inventory puzzles save for combining found keys on locks.",

      "description": "<i>The Solus Project</i> is a game about exploring and surviving in an alien environment. The game is set in the far future and it starts in 2115 when scientists discover a rogue Class-B star is travelling towards Earth. The collision is said to destroy our entire solar system. Three giant Prolus colony ships are launched in 2149 to a safe zone near Pluto. When Earth is destroyed two more years later, resources already start to dwindle and five scout ships are sent out to five distant worlds. The player's character is aboard of one of these ships when fifteen years later Mission TSP-3 (The Solus Project 3) arrives at Gliese-6143-C. The ship is shot out of the air and the character (male or female) awakens in an unknown environment with some scattered items in the ship's wreckage.\n\nMost of the game is spent exploring the new planet, both on the surface and in deep caves below the surface, looking for traces of ancient civilizations and a way out. At the same time attempts are made to contact the colony ships or the other scout ships. To progress it is often needed to use and combine items in the environment, especially for crafting, and with a large amount of freedom. At the same time it is also mostly a survival simulation. There are parameters such as body temperature, calories, water, sleep, world temperature, humidity, and wind that need to be taken into account, tracked through a PDA. At the start of the game the player decides how tough survival conditions are, ranging from Easy with a focus on exploration first, to the balanced Normal and eventually Hard as a hardcore survival game. It influences the available resources and how often they need to used. Harder difficulty levels removes visual helpers and objective markers. Later on artifacts and special equipment can be found that upgrade certain abilities and resistances, and improve attributes. This affects for instance inventory space, dive time when swimming, movement speed, climate resistance and health.\n\nStones can be sharpened into tools, water can be collected and drunk from sources, oil and dry roots can be attached to a bar to create a torch, and so on. There is however also a small amount of technology available, from what is left of the scout ship. This includes the PDA, but also rations for water and food, or a teleportation device, beacons, medpacks, backpacks, glowsticks etc. There are also many notes scattered around. The planet has capricious weather conditions and careful planning is needed when venturing too far from shelter. When caught in storms or freak weather conditions, the character can die, also from hypothermia, heat strokes, starvation and dehydration.",

      "description": "<i>Batman: The Telltale Series</i> is an episodic graphical adventure game based on the <i>Batman</i> comic series and not any previous adaptation. It is the second Telltale adaptation of a DC Comics franchise, following The Wolf Among Us and it uses a similar cel shaded visual style. The game mixes moments controlling business man Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego Batman with an even split. The game is set in Gotham City a few years after Wayne decides to become Batman. He is already fully equipped with gadgets and the batmobile, assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth, but no one knows his real identity yet. Both criminals and the police are however already aware of his actions. The game starts with a robbery at City Hall. Batman is there to fight the criminals, but a superhero Catwoman he has not encountered before turns up as well. At the same time, as Bruce Wayne, he endorses District Attorney Harvey Dent to become Gotham's new mayor, much to the chagrin of the current mayor Hill. Other important characters are the mob boss Carmine Falcone, reporter Vicki Vale, police lieutenant James Gordon and childhood friend Oswald Cobblepot. The event at City Hall sets a lot in motion that involves all the different characters.\n\nThe game consists of five episodes released over time:<ul>\n<li>Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 1: Realm of Shadows</li>\n<li>Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 2: Children of Arkham</li>\n<li>Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 3: New World Order</li>\n<li>Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 4: Guardian of Gotham</li>\n<li>Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 5: City of Lights</li></ul>This game entry either serves as a compilation of all episodes (X1) or as the only release of the game (PC). Depending on the platform, episodes can be purchased separately, as a single season pass, or both (PS3/PS4).\n\nThe game uses many familiar elements from previous Telltale games. A large part consists of cinematic sequences with no interactivity, and with dialogues between characters. At certain moments the player needs to choose a dialogue option from a small selection, or let the timer run out to use silence. There are other types of choices as well and these impact the consequences of events and relationships between characters. Choices are carried over to the next episodes and can be compared to those of players worldwide. At certain moment Wayne or Batman can also be controlled freely to explore small environments and examine items. There are also many Quick Time Events where quick reflexes are needed to win fights and get out tricky situations. In certain sequences shooting or throwing needs to be done by moving a target in a circle. If these are not done properly and in a timely fashion, the main character dies and the section needs to be replayed. Certain action scenes allow the player to control Batman's drone.\n\nAn entirely new element takes place at crime scenes. After examining different clues these can be linked together to establish the events. This is done by dragging items so they are connected. When completed the entire event is played out. The same technique is used to establish an attack plan for a fight, with different options to take out opponents. At the start of the game the player can choose between four colours for all bat technology. Crowd Play is an entirely new feature. It allows several additional users to participate using a web-enabled device such as a mobile phone. After entering the game using a unique code, all players can vote on choices so the one with most votes is chosen for the game. The same can be done to express emotions using a thumbs or a thumbs down. Participating users do not need to be in the same room, this can for instance also by done through Twitch streaming. The feature is available for both PC and consoles. Other elements are unlockable development videos, trailers, and a codex where all characters all gradually unlocked with background information.",

This version was created for consoles, but a few months later it was also provided as a free update to the owners of the PC version, also replacing the default PC version of the game in digital stores. The game itself is largely identical, but it was ported over from the original Source 3D engine to Unity 5. This version also introduces remastered audio and a Directors' Commentary with developers Jessica Curry, Robert Briscoe and Dan Pinchbeck. There are additional accessibility options: larger subtitles and a crosshair in addition to the original\u2019s FOV & brightness sliders and controller sensitivity menus and subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish and Russian trophies/achievements. There are some other tweaks and bug fixed as well.",

      "description": "<i>Virginia</i> is a game described as a thriller and played over the course of six days, from Monday to Saturday, and then further divided into many different scenes. It is set in the early nineties and the protagonist is FBI agent Anne Tarver. There are many different story threads, but the main one is that she investigates the disappearance of the boy Lucas Fairfax in the town of Kingdom, in Burgess County, Virginia, with her partner Maria Halperin. The story is not told in a chronological order, but consists of many different vignettes that reveal more about the characters, their intentions and the events. The game has no dialogue, voice-over or other type of text and TV series such as <i>Twin Peaks</i>, <i>Fargo</i> and <i>True Detective</i> are cited as direct inspirations, as well as the game Thirty Flights of Loving. The investigation has some fantasy and supernatural themes and many motifs, symbols and characters that return in different situations often with dreamlike sequences presented quickly one after the other. The story is largely left open to the player to interpret.\n\nThe game is entirely linear with limited player interaction. Some scenes provide free movement with exploration in any direction. A single cursor shown as a white dot is used to interact with the environment. When a certain part is interactive, the dot turns into a circle and then in a diamond when close enough. Interactions are then performed automatically as there are no choices, so the player mainly performs these small actions to further the story. As such, there are also no real puzzle-solving elements to the game. In other situations short cinematic sequences are shown with no free movement and only a small amount of looking around and interaction until the next event is triggered. Some scenes offer interactivity, but then move on after a certain time regardless of the actions. Some interactive elements are optional, used to unlock achievements.",

      "description": "<i>The Bunker</i> is a game about John, the last remaining survivor in a decommissioned government nuclear bunker in an alternative world version of Britain where nuclear war broke out in the mid-80s. He was born on 3rd July 1986, the day of the disaster, and 30 years later he is the only one left of the 59 people who were once inside. He has never seen the outside world, but has food supplies for more than 27 more years. Every day he follows a strict routine his mother has learned him: take the vitamins, check the radiation levels with the dosimeter, listen to the radio for activity, do a radiation check, eat and check on the remaining food, and finally he reads to his deceased mother, still lying covered in bed. That has gone well until day 11,111 when the server crashes and he needs a procedure to restore it. It causes him to break his routines and venture into the long forgotten areas of the bunker. There are also many flashbacks that reveal what took place previously.\n\nThe game consists almost entirely of live action full motion video shot on location at a real nuclear bunker along with a few static stills, complemented with a soundtrack. The video has no computer generated effects, CGI or motion capture. Sometimes small decisions are presented, such as choosing what to read, selecting an activity, turning a knob, reading a document and so on. The player controls a cursor and certain parts of the environment offer interactivity through hotspots. While the game is entirely linear and there are a few moments where a bad or late decision is \"rewound\", there is mostly no risk or time pressure aside from a small amount of Quick Time Events. When these are missed the scene needs to be replayed. Some small, optional elements are available, such as locating toys, locating computers, and reading documents.",

The only few hints about the \"possible\" story of the game and it's history of the boy protagonist are strewn across the scenery as floating texts.

In the process you discover the secret underwater city of Eden. But the city is in shambles, almost deserted, so it is up to you do find out what happened to its residents and rescue your beloved husband.\n\nThe game is a hidden-object, point-and-click adventure, with an art style very similar to the underwater BioShock games. There are three difficulty levels, which change highlighting of active spots, available hints, and more. There is a map marking rooms where actions are available. If you dislike the hidden object puzzles, you can opt for solving domino puzzles instead. Many cut-scenes help advance the story, which has supernatural horror elements.",

      "description": "In <i>Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter</i>, the player controls the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The game is set in late 19th century London. While Holmes and Dr. Holmes have been completely redesigned to look younger and more dynamic, the game is still set in the same timeline as the rest of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes games. While the four big cases are unrelated to each other, there is a framing story in which the detective has to deal with his adoptive daughter Kate (continuing the story of The Testament of Sherlock Holmes) and a mysterious new neighbor.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are mostly identical to the direct predecessor Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes: the player searches the environment for clues, interrogates suspects, solves mini games and makes deductions based on the found clues. While inspecting persons, Holmes now sometimes has to choose between two alternative interpretations, e.g. if a red stain on the suit is wine or blood. If the wrong alternative is chosen, it can't be taken back. While this does not tamper the ability to solve the case, the person's character interpretation in the log is marked as incomplete.\n\nThe major difference in comparison to <i>Crimes & Punishments</i> is that the investigating and interrogating parts have been scaled back in favor of the mini-games. While there are still many mini-games which can be solved quickly (e.g. using the lab to examine a piece of evidence, balancing or quick-time events), many are more involved: they are either action-based (e.g. Holmes needs to flee from an assailant while frequently taking cover) or large-scale logic puzzles. While the latter were always an integral part of the series, they were mostly gone from the direct predecessor. Most mini-games can be skipped.\n\nAdditionally there are multiple occasions where player control shifts to another character. Mostly it's just switching to Dr. Watson during a puzzle sequence, but sometimes there are longer parts like a stealth sequence with Wiggins (tailing a suspect without him noticing) or following a trail with Holmes' dog Toby. The game can be played in 1st or 3rd person perspective, but in some sequences 3rd-person is forced.",

      "description": "<i>A New Frontier</i> is the third season of Telltale's adaptation of <i>The Walking Dead</i> comic book series. It continues the previous games' concept as a narrative-driven title where most of the game is presented as a series of cinematic story scenes. Player interaction is limited to dialogue options during conversations, Quick Time Events in action scenes, and free movement and minor puzzle-solving elements in some environments that can be explored freely. It is an episodic series that comprises five installments released over time:<br><br><ol>\n<li>Ties That Bind Part One</li>\n<li>Ties That Bind Part Two</li>\n<li>Above the Law</li>\n<li>Thicker than Water</li>\n<li>From the Gallows</li></ol>The first two episodes where released simultaneously. As before, choices are carried over between episodes and lead to different events and experiences. This season has two playable protagonists, Javier Garcia and also Clementine, returning from the first two seasons. It starts with a flashback where Javier and his family are introduced prior to the zombie apocalypse. Then four years later in the present day Javi is on the road with Kate, his brother's wife, his nephew Gabe and his niece Mariana. They are constantly on the move to stay ahead of a large Walker herd, stopping for food, gas and resources wherever they can. The game's events kick off when they decide to stop at a junkyard.\n\nSoon, Clementine is introduced and she meets Javi, along with a large cast of new characters. What happened to Clem between the second and the third season is revealed through a series of interactive flashbacks, interspersing the present day events. Clem's character is shaped through the player's choices in all the previous games: what she experienced, who she shot or saved, where she went etc. These choices have led to 42 separate paths that could be followed. This third season handles that by allowing players to import saves from the previous seasons so the choices are carried over. For new players or those who lost their saves, there is the option to either have her background story be generated automatically, or to reshape it by answering a number of questions at the start of the game.\n\nMost of the mechanics and game elements return. Visually an identical style is used. This title supports Crowd Play, a feature first introduced in Batman: The Telltale Series, where an online audience can vote or suggest choices to experience and steer the game as a group. This game entry covers the third season as a whole, either because it is the only option to purchase the game (PC) or because it is available as a compilation (PS4 and Xbox One). For other platforms such as Android, iOS and also PS4 and Xbox One episodes are available separately. The first episode is bought as the base game and the others as DLC, either as individual purchases or as a season pass.",

      "description": "<i>Burly Men at Sea</i> is a game about the adventures of three fishermen, the brothers Beard: Brave Beard, Hasty Beard and Steady Beard. One day, they find a map inside a bottle at sea, but it only contains their own island. They return to their village to find out if some of the folks there know more. Eventually an old man reveals the map is there for them to complete with their own adventures, so they set sail and explore.\n\nThe game is meant to be played multiple times, each time starting again at the village, as there are different paths and encounters to discover. It is largely played as a visual novel and is described by the developers as \"a quiet adventure\". The story is told through images and text, with limited interaction by the player. At certain locations the men can be moved around and there are different choices to make, sometimes with small puzzle-solving elements, leading to different, branching paths in the story. Certain characters return with different conversations and story elements based on previous adventures or encounters. There are also many interactive elements in the background that can be clicked for a short animation, but they serve no further purpose.\n\nThe men can get eaten by a whale, meet nymphs and mermaids, race Death, experience the hospitality of a living mountain, meet a snake, get locked up, and more. Each completed adventure is represented through a book at the old man's coffee shop, based on four icons on the map, corresponding with four encounters. The combination of encounters that form a single adventure is also summarized through a code that can be entered on the developer's website. The adventure can then be bought as a physical book, based on the four encounters the player chose. It contains 50 full-colour pages and costs $30. The books shipped in January 2017.",
