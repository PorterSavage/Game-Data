      "description": "The first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series.  The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year.  The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date.  You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.\r\n\r\n",

You race against the top riders. Try to aim for the top.\n\nR.P.G. mode is interactive. You travel between locations, and explore them, and speak to any people here. You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help of the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.\n\nMulti-Play mode lets you \"link\" cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.",

      "description": "<i>Pinball Arcade</i> is based on the Pinball Hall of Fame series and includes accurate simulations of pinball tables from Gottlieb, Williams, Stern Pinball (which also includes its previous incarnations: Stern Electronics, Data East Pinball, and Sega Pinball) and Bally. The latter two companies were not previously featured. It includes four tables, one from each company, with support for additional tables through commercial downloadable content. The included tables are, in the order they appear on the game:<ul>\n<li><i>Tales of the Arabian Nights</i> (Williams, 1996) (previously included in Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection)</li>\n<li><i>Ripley's Believe it or Not!</i> (Stern Pinball, 2004)</li>\n<li><i>Black Hole</i> (Gottlieb, 1981) (previously included in Pinball Hall of Fame: The Gottlieb Collection)</li>\n<li><i>Theatre of Magic</i> (Bally, 1995)</li></ul>\nAlmost every version of the game is a free download, and they each come with <i>Tales of the Arabian Nights</i> included for no extra cost, alongside its Pro upgrade, while the PS3/Vita/360 versions, which are paid releases instead, come with the aforementioned four tables; these are referred to as the \"core pack\" on other versions.<br>\nThe game also features a large amount of additional tables available for download, including tables that were already on previous <i>Pinball Hall of Fame</i> titles (such as <i>Black Knight</i>, <i>Medieval Madness</i>, <i>Big Shot</i> and <i>Central Park</i>) and other tables never seen on other games (such as <i>Attack from Mars</i>, <i>Cirqus Voltaire</i> and <i>Bride of Pin-Bot</i>), alongside some based on licensed properties (from tables like <i>Creature from the Black Lagoon</i> and <i>Elvira and the Party Monsters</i> to ones like <i>Twilight Zone</i> and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>), as well as Season Packs, which compile the tables from a respective \"season\" into one, although table availability varies from platform to platform. The method to purchase tables and season packs also varies depending on the platform, with most versions handling it inside the game, whereas on PlayStation and Xbox versions these are listed on and purchased/downloaded through their respective storefronts, although the Windows version also has the Season Packs listed on the Steam Store.<br>\nThere is support for achievements/trophies and online leaderboards, and the game includes a few extras, such as a little history on the games and the original sales flyers, plus in-depth instructions on every element of each table. It also has support for online play in the form of various online tournaments held by FarSight.",

Bridges are constructed through constructions with different stress points based on materials such as wood, steel, cables and concrete. Each new bridge becomes longer and has a different environment (City, Canyon, Beach, Mountains, Hills) or height with new challenges.",

      "description": "<i>Monster Loves You</i> is an interactive fiction with graphics life simulator, where the player lives the life of a monster in the village of Omen \u2014 starting from the monster brooding pool, adolescence, adulthood, and, if it survives, elderhood \u2014 and may affect the world of monsters and humans.\n\nGameplay consists of decision making choices the player must make to determine the life course of the monster. These choices will affect attributes the monster has: bravery, ferocity, cleverness, honesty, and kindness. Including an invisible attribute: neurosurgery. Decisions made will either increase or decrease these attributes (e.g. +9 Ferocity), which in return will also affect the success rate of future choices since adulthood.\n\nWhen monster reaches adulthood, reputation comes into play, which may affect the monster's chances of becoming an elder. Failing to become an elder may mean certain death. Chances of success will greatly depend on the overall attributes and reputation the monster has accumulated throughout the game. If the monster successfully becomes an elder, it now has the choice to affect the lives and relations between monsters and humans. To coexist peacefully, destroy the humans or other alternatives are entirely up to the player.\n\nFinishing the game will unlock medals (achievements) commemorating the accomplishments the player has made.",

      "description": "<i>The Walking Dead Pinball</i> is a pinball game/table with the engine of <i>Pinball FX2</i> and based on The Walking Dead, the first season of Telltale's adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic book series. The field of play is made up out of various locations from the series (including the St. John\u2019s Dairy Farm, Travelier Motel, Bell Tower, Train & Level Crossing, RV and more) with no visually defined boundaries of where the table ends. The different missions in the game are inspired by the five episodes including split-decision choices that determine life and death for characters, provide solutions to problems, and help acquire tools, fuel or vehicles. Zombies are also part of the missions and they often need to be taken out or block off certain routes. There are various mini-games such as a sniper mission or a defense mission where you need to prevent zombies from getting too close. Next to the locations, the game also uses the music and various voice clips from the episodes. The scenery can change from day to night, making it dark and illuminating certain sections, as was previously done in the <i>Marvel Pinball: Blade</i> table. Lee and Clementine appear as 3D characters in the table.\n\nThe game is standalone for iOS and Android (Amazon version). The PC, Xbox, Wii U, and PlayStation versions require Pinball FX2 or Zen Pinball 2 (available for free) and then offer this table as DLC. For iOS it can also be bought as DLC for Zen Pinball and for Android as DLC for Zen Pinball HD (Google Play release).",

      "description": "<i>Zen Pinball 2</i> is the sequel to Zen Pinball, the equivalent of the <i>Pinball FX</i> games on Xbox and PC. The features and the visual style are similar to Pinball FX2. As with most games in the series it is free to play where tables are bought as DLC. For the PS3 and PS Vita this is done as a cross buy. For the later released PS4 version as well, but a table purchase is imported through the main menu. Cross buy does not apply to the PS4 version however, so to get them across all available PlayStation systems with a single purchase they need to be bought for the PS3 or the PS Vita.\n\nThe PS4, Macintosh, iOS and Android versions contain the full and unrestricted Sorcerer's Lair table for free. The full catalog of tables depends on the platform, though new tables are generally released for all available platforms. All tables can be played for free for a few minutes. The game has different viewpoints, both analog and digital ball launches based on the type of table, mini-games, 3D animations, leaderboards, tournaments and personal statistics. Offline multiplayer, in split-screen (consoles only) or taking turns, is available for two to four players respectively.\n\nFor iOS it is released as <i>Zen Pinball</i> as a follow-up free hub version to previous stand-alone table releases such as Zen Pinball: Rollercoaster and Zen Pinball: Inferno. For iOS as well as Android some table releases are still standalone next to the hub DLC version.",

      "description": "<i>Mars</i> is a DLC pinball table for Pinball FX2 (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows) and Zen Pinball 2 (PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U). It is set in the year 2100 when mankind first sets foot on the planet Mars. The player acts as the commander in charge of the mission. There are various tasks to complete, such as docking the space ship, scanning for distant galaxies with a satellite, calibrating a solar collector, collecting samples with a magnetic crane, using a spider to research Martian symbols, stabilizing gravity, refueling, deactivating Mars' defense systems and unlocking the secrets of a pyramid as the end game. Multiball is set in zero gravity. There is also a mission when the ship can freeze and the ball turns white.\n\nThere are two regular flippers at the bottom and an additional one near the mid right to reach a lane. The outer parts of the fields have lanes and they also lead to the spinners. In the centre there are various holes. The level has many 3D animations such as the space ship docking on the table and a spider hopping on the bottom of the table to activate kickback.",

The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. The table is designed around the adventures of knight Max, an enthusiastic, comical hero who goes on quests to defeat monsters. Max is always present as a 3D character in the top left part of the table. There is a quirky tone, with backgrounds on the side that change as in a theatre, Max' comments and him riding a wooden horse.\n\nThe table has a basic set of flippers at the bottom of the screen, a double outlane on the right and a triple on the left. There's another flipper near the top left of the table as the only means to reach a separate area. The game incorporates some RPG elements. By defeating monsters and completing quests Max earns experience (a red bar at the bottom of the table) and he can level up. He earns items and can buy new ones (by trading in the old ones) through a loot hole. These items alter his statistics, providing more damage, armor or adding elements elements to attack or defense. There are also different sets of epic items in a different colour. Experience and items are kept across game sessions, allowing the player to build the character. The monsters' level always matches the one of Max.\n\nThe game contains three locations with twelve monsters each unlocked gradually. Once a fight is started, health for both sides is shown at the bottom of the table. Time counts down from ten for each enemy hit and the player can perform various actions. The sword ramp is used to attack and shield to parry or counter attack (when followed up with the sword ramp). It is also possible to shoot a dodge lane to reset the timer and the spinners add seconds. A separate entrance called smash can also be used to attack directly. A dungeon hole to the right can be used to restore health when health potions have been collected.\n\nAfter defeating a monster a lane to the princess wheel in the bottom left part of the screen is opened up. The ball lands in a wheel with a bonus and after three balls princess multiball is activated. When all twelve monsters are defeated the wizard mode can be activated where the final opponent can only be defeated using magic. There are four magic scrolls to collect, mainly through the top left flipper that leads to the Orcanium area. There the flipper key or button is used to extend wooden poles that push the ball in one of four holes, providing a scroll. Magic can also be used during regular fights by going into Orcanium and outside of fights the Orcanium is used to challenge a monster through a theatre sequence. Other challenges are bat frenzy and skeleton swarm. There is also a wooden skillshot area near the top right of the screen.",

The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. The table is based on the Marvel character Captain America from the comic book series. In this table there is a final clash between Captain America and his nemesis Red Skull. The captain, Bucky and members of the Howling Commandos need to work together to assault Baron Zemo's castle and recover the Cosmic Cube from Red Skull.\n\nMissions include finding members of the local resistance, reading the archives and shutting down a dig site. Captain America, Red Skull and Baron Zemo appear as 3D animated characters on the table. There is a brawl between Captain America and Red Skull, the captain needs to deflect Zemo's death ray and get past Adhesive X that forms sticky pools on the table. The table has a regular set of flippers at the bottom and an additional one on the right. The Cosmic Cube is a large piece in the centre at the back with multiple targets. There are multiple ramps, three outlanes on the left and two on the right. The ball can be shot into a mini playfield on the top left where Zemo's castle is attacked by having the ball hit targets, not using flippers but magnets. There is an additional mini-game in the top left where Captain America needs to deflect incoming shots with his shields. He needs to turn left or right in the direction where the shots appear.",

The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. This table's theme is paranormal phenomena. As a paranormal detective you investigate hauntings and strange creatures.\n\nThe game has a basic set of flippers at the bottom and an additional one on the right to reach a separate ramp. By launching the ball through a long ramp on the right, it reaches another flipper in the top left. This flipper is used to shoot the ball up a set of stairs towards the door of a haunted mansion and another path to the right that leads to a cube. The flipper on the right accesses the Nessie ramp where a spinner can make you take snapshots of the Loch Ness monster. This ramp leads to a separate area below the main flippers with another flipper to reach another part on the right. Locking balls opens up a mini-game in the cube near the top, mainly to activate multiball phenomena.\n\nOther game elements include a poltergeist ball trapped on the left side of the table, a dizzy mode with a chupacabra, annoying the jersey devil, and a mission based around the bermuda triangle. When the door towards the haunted mansion is open, the ball can be launched inside, in a separate 2D area where the ball goes extremely fast. There are various targets and an upper floor. A UFO can take the ball up. There is also a LED video mini-game where you chase a mutant alligator and the flipper buttons are used to turn left or right at intersections.",

      "description": "<i>The Sims 4</i> is the fourth main game in the real-time life simulation / management series. Just like the previous games one or more custom characters are created through Create-a-Sim to live in a house designed by the player. As their lives unfold based on the environment, relationships and specific traits, the player gets to manage the life, needs to organize activities, attend to needs, and react to moods, with non-linear gameplay and no direct control.\n\nThe character creation process has been expanded. Players choose a gender, age (from child to elder), look and outfit. The voice can be adjusted from clear to brash and a specific walking style can be chosen to reflect the personality. Next to a selection of various facial and body features, every element of the character can also be tweaked by holding and dragging with a large choice of colours and accessories. Players also choose a lifetime aspiration from a number of fields such as athleticism, creativity, family, knowledge, love ... with deeper choices for each. Next, three traits (one less than the previous game) are selected such as active, cheerful, gloomy, romantic or self-assured, and specific characteristics such as hobbies, lifestyle and social intelligence. The game puts a larger emphasis on personalities and social interactions. Sims are now for instance also able to multitask, rather than completing actions one by one, and these are also affected by moodlets and emotions. While playing players are rewarded for reacting to moods, providing temporary buffs or permanent enhancements to the Sims, for small accomplishments. The available interactions are largely based on the chosen personality.\n\nThe bottom left of the interface holds an action queue where various activities the Sim wants to do are listed. At the bottom are time controls to manage how time passes. There is free camera rotation and various zoom levels to follow the activity from any angle. Sims level up by practicing activities. The game's main currency Simoleons is used to provide for the chosen lifestyle and to buy new items. The build mode has been made easier as items now often click together to form a coherent structure. Entire rooms can be picked up and placed elsewhere and the push-and-pull tool from the character creation mode can be used to alter the walls. The game has two neighbourhoods with ten public venues in total, such as bars, a museum, a park, a gym, and a library. Work locations and co-workers are not shown in the game.\n\nThe Create-a-Style mode from the previous game where surfaces and textiles could be painted with a custom design has been dropped in favour of predetermined colour sets. The game also no longer employs a seamless open world for different locations, but links together smaller environments with loading screens. All of the terrain has been flattened, without hills, and transportation is no longer present.",

      "description": "<i>Earth Defense</i> is a DLC pinball table for Pinball FX2 (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows) and Zen Pinball 2 (PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U). The PS3 and PS Vita versions are Cross-Buy. After buying that version, it can be transferred for free to the PS4 version as well.\n\nIn this table your are the captain of the Earth Defense Special Forces and you need to defend Pinball City against the Flip-Bot and his minions. The Flip-Bot is a huge robot in the top right part of the table and takes up a large portion of the screen. To defeat him ten medals need to be earned through different missions. You can attempt to attack the bot directly, you can fight mini-bosses and you have to help civilians escape. In the City Destroyer mission you need to keep the ball in the upper part of the playfield for ten seconds. In Data Bowl you hit the drop targets in front of the Flip-Bot to steal the robot plans. In Artillery you use the launch cannon to choose a trajectory and then you have a limited amount of time to reach that target. You can also save a girl and there is an airstrike and a panic multiball with many jackpot lanes. The robot can toy with the ball by launching shots, changing the ball's trajectory. In Invasion you have a limited amount of time to shoot the ball into the rescue hole to stop the invasion. If not, Flip-Bot keeps adding balls (up to three) until you are overwhelmed.\n\nThe table focuses on the robot and the two large ramps reach around it. There is also a center ramp and an additional flipper in the top right next to the regular ones to reach another lane. Many activities are activated by launching the ball over the same ramp multiple times in succession. The left part of the screen is used to access a cannon, a subway to transport civilians, and a large UFO. There are two outlanes on the right and three on the left. Most of the targets can be found in the middle of the screen.",

The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. It is based on the Marvel comic book character Doctor Strange. The world is threatened by two dimensional rulers: Nightmare and Dormammu. You need to help Doctor Strange, called the Sorcerer Supreme who protects Earth against mystical threats, to stop the invasion.\n\nThere is a basic set of flippers at the bottom and an additional one in the top left. The bottom of the table has three outlanes on each side. The design is largely focused on various long ramps and loops where shots can be combined quickly into combos. They also provide a path around the back of the table and are used to reach the spinners, as well as through the additional flipper. There are four jackpots in total and different abilities can be leveled up, such as intellect, wisdom and spirit, with short 'hurry up' sequences. There are trainings to complete, such as the arcane training and the alchemy training. When the two trainings are completed a multiball is activated.\n\nThe main missions for Doctor Strange are activated by shooting down the droptargets below him. For Strange, as well as the three other characters (Nightmare, Dormammu and Baron Mordo) two missions are available for each. They also appear as animated characters on the table. When the wisdom level is completed a hole in the middle of the playfield is activated. It leads to a mini playfield based around the Eye of Agamotto.",

      "description": "<i>Assetto Corsa</i> is a driving simulator. Its stress is on physics models and vehicles' dynamic behaviour (a proprietary physics engine is employed) and general realism; for example, the tyre rubber deposited on track\n(depending on the laps and amount of in-race cars) and the sun position (depending by geographical coordinates\nof the track and by the sun curve according to time and date) in order to get the same light conditions of the real tracks, are calculated in real time.\n\nGame modes are:<ul><li>solo mode: career, practice, special events (drag races, drift challenges, other challenges</li> <br>\n<li>solo and multiplayer: quick race (totally both in solo and online multiplayer mode) , race weekend (free practice, qualifying session and race), multiplayer</li></ul>Solo and multiplayer races are editable. Driver assistance is offered in 4 settings, resulting in 4 levels of difficulty: gamer, racer, pro, totally customisable (ranging from wholly simulative setting to assistance allowing play with the joystick, from real-world car damage \u2014 both aesthetical and functional \u2014 to disabling it completely).\n\nThe game plays from a first-person view, or from inside the cockpit, on the hood, or exterior. Supported control peripherals include steering wheels, professional simulative devices and the most common motion systems, as well as keyboard, joystick, gamepad. Also featured are triple monitor view, track IR, 3D VISION, and the Oculus Rift. Additional features are car customization, car setup, time of the day selection, telemetry and real-time\ncontrol of movable aerodynamics parts by telemetry input channels, replay and photo mode features, live track, as well as an \u201capp\u201d system (in-game overlay). The number of online racers is determined by the amount of pit-boxes available on the given race circuit. Editing tools, the same as those used by the development team, are available for vehicle and circuit modding. It is possible to retrieve telemetry data in real time (either via UDP, shared memory, Python or C + + plug-in).\n\nLicensed circuits are:<ul><li>Imola</li>\n<li>Magione</li>\n<li>Monza</li>\n<li>Monza year 1966</li>\n<li>Mugello</li>\n<li>N\u00fcrburgring</li>\n<li>N\u00fcrburgring Sprint</li>\n<li>Silverstone</li>\n<li>Silverstone International</li>\n<li>Silverstone National</li>\n<li>Spa Francorchamps</li>\n<li>Trento Bondone hill climb</li>\n<li>Vallelunga</li>\n<li>Vallelunga Club</li></ul>The licensed car roster currently includes (as of December 2014, more vehicles may be added later):<ul><li>Abarth (500 EsseEsse)</li>\n<li>Classic Team Lotus (Type 49, 98T)</li>\n<li>BMW (M3 E30 Sport Evolution, Z4 E89 35is, 1 Series M coup\u00e8, M3 E92, M3 E30 Group A, Z4 GT3, Z4 GT3, M3 GT2)</li>\n<li>Ferrari (F1 312T, F40, 458 Italia, 599XX EVO, 458 GT2, LaFerrari)</li>\n<li>KTM (X-Bow R)</li>\n<li>Lotus Cars (Elise SC, Exige 240R, Exige Scura, Evora S, Evora SR, Evora GTE, Exige S Roadster, Exige S, 2-11, 2-11 GT4, Evora GTC, Exos T125)</li>\n<li>McLaren (MP4 12C, MP4 12C GT3)</li>\n<li>Mercedes-Benz (SLS, SLS GT3)</li>\n<li>Pagani (Zonda R, Huayra)</li>\n<li>Scuderia Glickenhaus (P4/5 Competizione)</li>\n<li>Tatuus (F-Abarth)</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Project CARS</i> is a racing simulation similar to the Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports and GTR FIA Racing series. Different to those titles the game does not offer initial content where the player has to race and earn experience to perform upgrades and additional cars and tracks. Instead, all of the content is available right away and players can race in any mode, class, car and on any circuit immediately. Similar to games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa it offers very detailed customization where players can fine-tune almost any aspect of the cars, but contrary to those two titles there is not only multiplayer racing, but also a full career mode with offline races against AI-controlled opponents. Optionally various assists can be enabled to simply the gameplay.\n\nThe game offers circa 70 cars in various types of motorsports such as classic retro tour cars, traditional road cars, karts, track day cars, supercars, modern open wheel cars, GT cars and Le Mans prototypes. Brands include Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Ford, Lotus, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Renault and more. Brands such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are not included. Certain cars are part of a modified car pack, some are tied to a specific edition and others are given away for free each month. The game includes a large amount of racing circuits from around the world as well as a number of fictional ones and also point-to-point races.\n\nThe career mode offers several goals to climb the ranks, win championships and earn contracts to race in higher series. Examples of challenges include <i>Defending Champ</i> to win three seasons in a row undefeated, <i>Triple Crown</i> to win three different types of championships and <i>Zero to Hero</i> where you go through championships for the different race classes, from karts to Formula 1. There are several championships presented as race weekends split up in practice rounds, qualifiers and race sessions that often consist of multiple races. Optionally certain sessions can be skipped or simulated. It is possible to design custom races, there are various weather conditions and the developers organize events regularly. Online multiplayer is not done through matchmaking but through playlists curated by the developer. Next to regular races it is possible to challenge other players to time trials. The Driver Network keeps track of the player's progress, stats and results for the various cars and parts of the game. \n\n<i>CARS</i> from the title is an acronym for <i>Community Assisted Racing Simulator</i>, which reflects the game's development. The game was crowd funded where contributors could involve themselves in the development through Tool Packs which allowed for the creation of assets, content, QA and other parts of the development process with various rewards.",

      "description": "<i>Farming Simulator 15</i> is the 2015 edition of the farming simulation series. It largely continues the gameplay from the previous games in a sandbox environment. Players start with a small farm and by managing it efficiently the scope can be expanded while profits bring in new and better gear such as powerful tractors, harvesters and high capacity trailers. As in the previous games almost every action, such as connecting attachments, sowing, fertilization, plowing, harvesting, taking produce to the market and feeding animals need to be done manually. Two new types of activities for this release are animal husbandry and forestry, but at a high starting cost. For forestry players can plant and cut down trees. The wood can be sold to a lumber mill and wood chippings to a heating plant. Many new types of vehicles and machines are introduced for this activity.\n\nThis time there are two types of settlements to choose from to build a farm. There is the village Bjornholm with Scandinavian influences and Westbridge Hills with a US-influence. The general gameplay is identical for both settlements with similar delivery points such as train stations and windmills, but the American town has larger fields, making it more challenging. This game adds 20 new licensed manufacturers for equipment, such as New Holland tractors, MAN trucks, Ponsse, Case IH, Deutz-Fahr etc. with 140 vehicles and farming tools in total. Also new is the ability to control washing equipment from a first-person perspective to clean machinery and implements. Even though there is a sandbox environment, there are many types of missions and objectives that are rewarded with cash for completing them.\n\nAll versions except PS3 and Xbox 360 support cooperative online games. Several players (up to six for PS4/Xbox One) can work together and the host can bring his single-player game online for others to participate, while at the same time carefully managing them, for instance by not making all cash available to everyone, but providing sums where needed along with several other limitations the host can define.",

      "description": "<i>Rocksmith 2014</i> is the sequel to Rocksmith. As its predecessor, it is a music game which uses an actual electric guitar as a controller, but now designed more as a learning tool than a game. The gameplay is essentially the same: notes are shown floating on a board towards an overlay of the guitar's fingerboard near the bottom of the screen and players must hit them as they reach it. The presentation, though, is different: there is no more a \"journey\" mode where the player progresses through events with set lists organized by difficulty. Instead, the game is guided by \"missions\", objectives that must be achieved in some of the available modes in the game. These modes are:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Learn a song: as the name describes, here the player chooses a song to be learnt. Songs can be chosen in no particular order, but the game will recommend songs in a specific progression to help beginners to learn how to play the instrument. The game will also recommend specific lessons or techniques to be learnt or practiced, judging by the players' previous performance. While playing a song, the player can enter a mode called \"Riff Repeater\", where specific parts of the song can be chosen and repeated until mastery. There are several options in this mode, like setting a starting difficulty or speed; once the player reaches mastery in this level of difficulty or speed, the game will level up, increasing the difficulty or speed. Number of repetitions, error tolerance and the ability of viewing previous mistakes are also available.</li>\n\t<li>Session mode: in this mode the player jams with a virtual band. The player selects number and kinds of instruments to play with, the music genre, key, scale (pentatonic minor, for instance), tempo and complexity. The game then shows the main interface with highlighted notes through the fingerboard, telling the player what notes should be played to keep it in key and what notes to emphasize. The band has A.I. and is responsive to how the music is being played, so depending on the intensity or speed of the notes being played, it will follow the player.</li>\n\t<li>Nonstop play: in this mode players create a set list of one or more songs and plays them in sequence, with no intervals between them (except for tuning when needed).</li>\n\t<li>Lessons: here the player can access lessons from the simplest ones like holding the guitar or the pick to more advanced ones two-hands or harmonics techniques. The lessons are presented in video and then the player must practice what was shown. The game recognizes errors and tells the players where they did wrong and what it takes to fix it.</li>\n\t<li>Guitarcade: 11 mini-games allow the player to train specific techniques. They are:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Gone Wailin', a volume dynamics forced side-scroller;</li>\n\t<li>String Skip Saloon, a string skipping game with an old-west shooter theme;</li>\n\t<li>Ducks ReDux, a duck shooting fretting game;</li>\n\t<li>Ninja Slide N, a game where the player controls a ninja slicing ghosts with slides;</li>\n\t<li>Scale Warriors, a beat'em up scales game;</li>\n\t<li>Return to Castle Chordead, a chords rail shooter resembling House of the Dead;</li>\n\t<li>Hurtlin' Hurdles, a tremolo game with an Olympiad theme;</li>\n\t<li>Temple of Bends, a bends platformer;</li>\n\t<li>Scale Racer, an arcade racer game for practicing scales;</li>\n\t<li>Star Chords, another chords rail shooter, now with a sci-fi theme;</li>\n\t<li>Harmonic Heist, a game where the player controls the movements of a thief in a museum with harmonics.</li>\n</ul>\n\t<li>Multiplayer: two players can play co-op in this mode (two Real Tone cables are needed).</li>\n\t<li>Tone designer: an assortment of guitar amps and pedals is available so players can create their own tone. The gear available ranges from actual manufacturers like Marshall and Orange to fictitious ones designed specifically to the game.</li>\n</ul>\nAll Rocksmith DLC songs are compatible with <i>Rocksmith 2014</i>.",

Players can choose between a variety of plague types, including Virus, Fungus, Bacteria etc. Aside from the official types, players can also create and share custom plagues via the Steam Workshop.\n\nPlayers start by initially infecting a country of their choosing. After that, the player must upgrade their plague in order to infect more people, develop different symptoms, and develop resistance to cure attempts that will gradually take place. These factors will change depending on the plague type, and the difficulty setting. The game can end for various reasons: if the plague destroys the world, if the plague is cured, or if there are survivors after all other victims have been killed. \n\nThe game offers four difficulty settings, Casual, Normal, Brutal and Mega Brutal. The game supports cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.",

      "description": "<i>Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist</i> is a 2015 simulated card game based off the Yu-Gi-Oh! Franchise.  The first Yu-Gi-Oh! game to be played on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, <i>Legacy of the Duelist</i> features over 6,600 playable cards and 90 characters, the most of any previous installment. The game allows you to play in various game modes all which require you to create powerful decks filled with monsters, magic and trap cards in order to defeat your opponent in battle.\n\nThe story campaign of <i> Legacy of the Duelist</i> allows you to relive popular battles between characters in the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime. You begin by choosing one of the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds, Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V) and then following in chronological order of the TV show you begin to duel numerous characters.  Each victory against the opponent rewards you with 3 cards from the opposite deck, a deck recipe so you can recreate the opponents deck, and Duel Points (DP).  DP are used in the card shop to purchase any one of the 24 booster packs in game.  Once you complete any story mission the game allows you to participate in a Reverse Duel where you take control of your opponents deck and battle with it.  Completing and winning in all of a characters duel will unlock a challenge deck; allowing you to face that character in a match of better cards and higher difficulty.\n\nBattle Pack mode contains both Draft Play and Sealed Play. In Battle Pack mode, the player begins by purchasing one of the three Battle Packs in game: Epic Dawn, War of the Giants and War of the Giants - Round 2.  Then, if playing in Draft Play, the player is given 3 rounds to draft cards in order to create a 40 card deck.  Sealed mode will automatically create the deck for you.  Afterwards the player takes their newly created deck and uses it online to battle other players.  Completing a match with 3 wins (or 3 losses), will give you the option to add those cards into your card trunk.\n\nThe online component of the game allows you to duel against players from around the world. You can play in both Ranked and Unranked matches and each have different rules.  <i>Legacy of the Duelist</i> adheres to the banlist of the physical card game.  This means that certain cards deemed too powerful have been either completely banned or limited to 1-2 copies during duels by Konami. Playing online with Unranked rules allows you to ignore the banlist and use any cards you want in your deck.  Meanwhile playing in Ranked will do the opposite and you prevent you from using the banned cards in gameplay. \n\nThe game also features trophies and achievements, and the paid DLC allows you to purchase a story battle, reverse battle, and obtain special custom recipes not in game.",

      "description": "<i>Guitar Hero Live</i> is an entry in the <i>Guitar Hero</i> series and a reboot of the franchise after the hiatus following Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock in 2010. The core concept is identical: players use a plastic guitar peripheral to play the guitar sections of songs by following the cues on the screen and pressing the matching buttons on the instrument in time. Unlike the contemporary Rock Band 4 there is no backwards compatibility with instruments of content from earlier games. The largest difference compared to earlier titles is in the presentation. In the Guitar Hero Live mode each song is now played from the perspective of the guitarist during a real-world concert setting using full motion video footage. While playing the camera shifts between watching and interacting with the band members and the audience. Based on the player's performance there are dynamic transitions in the video, as the band members will encourage or scold you and the same goes for the audience.\n\nThe game is sold as a bundle with one or two guitar controllers and also as a retail package for the mobile iOS platform where the game itself is downloaded for free with an in-app purchase of $50 to unlock the full digital content. The instrument has been redesigned for six fret buttons instead of three and they are now lined up in two rows of three buttons. There is also a strum bar. While playing notes appear on a scrolling \"highway\" in the centre of the screen with the video playing behind it. There are three lanes and a white and a black colour is used to differentiate between the top or the bottom row on the instrument. A note becomes a black and white square when two buttons need to be pressed together. Each song can be played in multiple difficulty levels. On the casual difficulty only one row of buttons is used (white notes) and on higher ones (starter and especially advanced) there are often quick combinations of buttons in multiple rows. There is also a casual difficulty level where only the strum bar needs to be used. Power chords generally use the top row. Like earlier titles Hero Power (previously called Star Power) can be collected by correctly playing a specific series of blue notes on a track. These are marked with on-screen guitar picks. After collecting it, it can be unleashed at any time by tilting the controller upward or pressing a button at the bottom. Using the power instantly pleases the crowd and can save a performance. Yellow notes are tied to a notestreak. There is a short, interactive tutorial in the begin that explains the controls. \n\nThe first part of the game is called Guitar Hero Live. It is an offline story/career mode where the player becomes a guitarist for different fictitious bands playing existing tracks from popular bands on a number of fictitious festivals. Each band plays a set of three or four songs on different stages of the festival and during the day or at night. This portion of the game contains 42 different tracks for different genres such as rock, alternative, metal, rap and dubstep. By completing songs they become available for Quick Play.\n\nThe second part of the game is the online Guitar Hero TV mode. It offers multiple channels that stream songs all day long and most of the time different from those in the Guitar Hero Live mode. It was launched with 200 songs and new ones are added regularly. The genre switches after some time. Unlike the offline mode the channels contain video clips and live performances of the songs by the real bands as the player plays along and there are no dynamic interactions in the video. The game tracks the players performance and scores can be compared worldwide. This mode can also be played in split-screen multiplayer. To play specific songs a play coin needs to be used. The coins can be bought with points earned with performances or as microtransactions/in-app purchases for real money. There is a leveling system and the ability to unlock player card skins, different highways and different types of Hero Power to boost score multipliers, decrease note density or clear all notes for a short section. In-game credits earned by completing songs can be used to access a Premium channel with rotating challenges and asynchronous multiplayer against other players for the best scores. This channel often has different songs. Optionally real money can be used to buy in-game credits or a party pass to unlock all features of the game for 30 minutes or 24 hours without having to spend additional credits during that period.",

      "description": "<i>Rock Band 4</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Rock Band</i> series released five years after the previous main title Rock Band 3. It continues the concept of the earlier games where players simulate playing music using peripherals designed as instruments to mimic playing the lead and bass guitar and drums, and singing the vocals to songs. Unlike the contemporary Guitar Hero Live it has backwards compatibility for the instruments and content of the previous games in the same console family. The wireless guitar and drum controllers from the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of previous <i>Rock Bands</i> can be used. For the PS4 this is done using the existing USB dongle and for the Xbox One with a new dongle included with the game. It is also sold as a <i>Band-in-a-Box</i> bundle with a wireless Fender Stratocaster guitar, a wireless drum kit, and USB microphone, or just the guitar. Two instruments introduced in <i>Rock Band 3</i> are no longer supported: the Pro Guitar and the Keyboard. The new instruments are fairly similar, but have been redesigned. Like in the previous game the drum kit can be expanded with three pads that act as symbals to use in the Pro Drum mode. Songs purchased as DLC for previous versions of the game can be carried over inside the same console family free of charge granted they has been ported over to support the features of the new version of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to the earlier games and the visual style is still based on animated characters and environments. One or more players use the instruments and microphone to play and sing through songs by following the cues on the screen. The score is based on the accuracy. Certain sections are marked with coloured notes. When these are completed successfully, an Overdrive meter is filled. When sufficiently full it can be activated to double the score multiplier for a short while. The base game contains 63 tracks, with both new ones and some that were previously available as DLC for earlier games.\n\nFreestyle solos are a new feature for the game. There are sections with solos for individual instruments where there are no prompts on the screen to follow. The player is entirely free to improvise, but to score there are a few general rules to follow. Using the guitar a blue colour shows the upper buttons need to be used and an orange colour the bottom ones. There are also hints when to match the beat, when to fingertap or to only use long notes. Optionally this feature can be disabled and then a predetermined solo needs to be followed. For the drums there are now drum fills replacing the freestyle sections of the previous game. For the vocals, when playing on 'hard' or 'expert', it is possible to boost the multiplier by singing an octave higher or lower as soon as the pitch is generally correct. Like in earlier games some songs have harmonies for up to three parts.\n\nIn the main career mode a starting band is introduced who needs to make it to the top. Instead of just completing songs to progress, the game presents various options for gigs that hold certain risks and rewards, from the attendance of fans based on the chosen region to the amount of money that can be earned and the opportunities it opens for the future career. For instance, if a band mainly chooses money and plays corporate sponsored gigs, this may influence the fanbase and possible future venues. The money earned through performances can be used to customize the band's instruments and clothes. The band members can be designed as custom avatars with various options for the looks and clothes. Players can also decide to hire a stylist and choose how to travel around. Remaining overdrive and multipliers are sometimes carried over between songs. The game no longer has online multiplayer or a practice mode. There is quick play and a new mode called shows, as a series of songs broken up in sets. The songs are largely predetermined but the players can vote on them between songs or during parts of the song when their instrument is not active.",

      "description": "<i>This War of Mine: The Little Ones</i> is a game for consoles based on the PC title This War of Mine. The majority of the game is identical. It is a war survival and base building simulation where the player controls a group of survivors trapped inside a building during a civil war. The goal of the game is to survive a certain amount of days. During the day the game is set entirely inside the single building where they seek shelter. At night they can head out to gather resources, food and items for instance to construct a stove or a workshop. There are many different parameters to take into account and the night raids involve hostile situations as well as choosing whether to rob or leave alone an elderly couple for instance.\n\nThe largest addition for this version is the introduction of children as playable characters. They are different from adults as they cannot venture outside at night. They also cannot participate in many activities such as cooking, guarding or constructing items. Children are often left alone at night and require attention and comfort when the adults return and they lead to new considerations for taking decisions. Children are able to perform small tasks such as gathering meat from traps or putting wood in a heater. They can also learn new activities from adults. Children consume less food than adults and if they are not sad they will start to play, for instance by drawing on the walls or with toys that can be constructed as a new type of item. They also have often less demands than an adult would in the same situation.\n\nThe introduction of these new characters also leads to new types of campaigns and missions including children. Right from the start there is a campaign with a father and a daughter, but others can be unlocked later on. As in the original game most of the parameters are randomized for each session. As with an update to the PC version, it is possible to create new scenarios and characters. An additional \"large mansion\" shelter is exclusive to the PS4 version.",

Leaving the taxing big city life behind, you embark upon a quest to restore the neglected tract through dedication and hard work.\n\nThe gameplay consists of keeping the plot of land clean from decaying plants, stones, logs and stumps, planting and fostering new vegetation, discovering new places, combating hostile animals and monsters, earning money and collecting materials in order to create new tools and buildings, joining in social activities and events, befriending and romancing non-playable characters, all while managing the protagonist's energy levels.\n\nThere are multiple subplots which the player may choose to impact, for example, one may choose to hinder or help Joja Corporation in outselling smaller businesses in order to control and renew the town which would rid it of its traditions. The game is an open-ended one and there is no official ending. The content changes often as it being updated regularly based on player feedback.",

      "description": "<i>Elite: Dangerous</i> is a game that combines space exploration, combat and trading in a futuristic setting. It is the fourth game in the <i>Elite</i> series and the sequel to the 1995 Frontier: First Encounters. It is set in an open world based on the real Milky Way and it is persistent in the way that it started in the year 3300 when it was launched in 2014 and time runs in sync with ours. As in the previous games the player starts with a small ship and a limited amount of 'credits' and needs to make a name by exploring an enormous galaxy said to contain 400 billion star systems. There are both noble and infamous paths to follow with many different types of jobs involving bounty hunting, exploring, fighting, mining, piracy, smuggling or trading, but always with the goal of acquiring capital to invest in larger ships, advanced equipment and cargo bays to store goods. There is a laws and crime system in place tied to a reputation. The game has fines and bounties, but players can also buy insurance.\n\nWhile the single-player of the previous games remains, there is an important persistent element as the choices of the different players across their own games impact the larger open-ended narrative. The game also needs a constant internet connections as the economy is based on the global player action by buying or selling resources and how the three factions (Alliance, Empire and Federation) interact through Power Play: galaxy-wide faction-based challenges. There are cycles in place that are re-calculated every week based on extensive systems involving financial, political and social weight that can be directly influenced by players, for instance by pledging to or withdrawing support from powers. Expansion on the map can be achieved in the same way. A Solo mode can be played to never encounter a human player, but there is also real multiplayer, either the Open Play mode as a large free-for-all or working cooperatively, or the Private mode to only play with a select number of friends. During space travel players encounter stars, planets, moons, black holes and asteroid fields.\n\nSpace flight is a simulation in the sense that there are a lot of controls to master and interpreting the HUD with afterburner, cargo, communications, compass, docking, fuel, heat, hull, landing gear, lasers, power, scanning, shields, speed, transactions etc. Travelling is done through standard space flight, hyperspace jumps or super cruise. During fights many types of manoeuvres are supporting through engine boosts, pitch, roll, throttle, thrust and yaw. Ships are customized through large amount of modules such as drives, fuel scoop, fuel tank, heat sink launcher, life support, power distributor, power plant, sensors, shield generator, weapons etc.\n\nThe later released spin-off Elite: Dangerous - Arena was integrated into the main game for free as an additional option in the launcher.",

      "description": "<i>Driveclub VR</i> is in a way a subset of the original Driveclub game containing both off-line and on-line races. As the name implies, the game gives an importance on creating or joining online clubs with other players and earning points by competing in various races. For offline mode, the same type of races still appear, such as racing with other opponents (AI offline or other players online), time trials, free driving which lets you explore the surrounding of each track with a VR helmet without pressure of winning, or drifting.\n\nThere are dozens of cars available, but at the beginning only two are unlocked. The rest become available as you drive and in doing so level up. Character creation is also available, but unlike in role-playing games, you can choose only sex, one of the several faces, clothes, and helmet style. When racing you can use factory color of a car, club colors if you are part of an online club, or do your own coloring and design. Tracks are split and selected per countries (Scotland, India, Japan, etc.) and vary in terrain from city streets and actual racing tracks to snowy mountains. While the weather effect selection is only limited to clear and cloudy, time of day can be set by clock which will result in racing at sunset, noon, dawn, or night.\n\nEach of the cars can be examined from the outside by rotating and rising the circular pedestal they're on. You cannot open doors or peek inside, but that is more than explorable when driving a car from the cockpit perspective. This is VR game so zooming in or out basically means moving your head toward the object you wish to see more closely. Driving perspective include cockpit view which lets you see full car interior and rely on rear mirrors and turning your head, hood view which is down to earth front view showing nothing but a small silhouette of the front bumper or something similar, and 3rd-person perspective which although in VR looks just as real since you follow your car from the bird's perspective right behind it unless it swerves.\n\nDriving off road is not forgiving and you'll often be prompted to get back on track with a click of a button or to manually drive yourself back. During cockpit view the distance, the speed and other info will be visible on a GPS-like device in your car, while switching to 3rd-person or hood view will show all the info at the top of the screen. The VR does not know boundaries, meaning that while inside the cockpit view you can literally move your head outside the car's window or roof and make yourself a unique outside of a car driving perspective.",

      "description": "<i>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</i> is a first-person VR experience of being onboard a Federation starship, namely on the ship's bridge where most of the key officers are, and boldly go on various perilous missions where strategy, tactics, and teamwork are key to success and getting back home in one piece. While the game was initially released as a VR-only title, via a later patch it also started supporting TV mode gameplay, which provides higher resolution but lower character immersion, as well as the lack of full camera angle views that can be achieved with VR headset.\n\nThe game requires a Ubisoft user account and online connection in order to start it, which additionally keeps track of latest add-ons, community events, and provides the ability to play online, whether skirmish missions or campaign mode. The entire gameplay takes place on the ship's bridge, but the character camera can be switched to the external one where the camera is placed on top of the player's starship, giving the player a chance to see the space, planets, asteroids, starships, battles, and everything external as if being there, which gives a feel of 3rd-person spaceship navigation during TV mode, but provides a somewhat astronaut-in-space feel when played in VR mode.\n\nThere are four key player characters in this game:\n<ul>\n<li> Captain - gives orders, decides what to do, how to do something, and where to go</li>\n<li> Helm - steers the ship, adjusts the heading, changes between impulse and warp speeds</li>\n<li> Tactical - analyzes targets, keeps track of ship's shields, fires phasers and torpedoes</li>\n<li> Engineer - performs ship repairs, distributes power between engine and weapons</li>\n</ul>\nEach of the four main characters can be an actual player (co-op online up to 4 players), or a single player can control all four (one at the time, remaining three are controlled by AI). While the captain has a set of pre-set commands he or she can activate, the game also supports voice commands to which AI crew will react, while in co-op mode players can simply talk to each other and execute team decisions. While the game uses a 1st-person perspective, each of the players can generate their own character (race, gender, head style, and hair style), which is how they will appear to other players or themselves in singleplayer when viewed from another character's perspective.",
