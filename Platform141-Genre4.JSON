The aim is to create routes linking some cities randomly assigned to you.\n\nEach turn, a player does one of the three following actions :\n1) draw new \"tickets\", that is, cards assigning you new secret objectives, usually consisting of a pair of distant cities you have to connect\n2) draw cards which, in combination, will later allow you to construct railroad linking adjacent cities. It's by serially connecting those adjacent cities that you'll  eventually connect the distant cities of your objectives\n3) play those cards and link adjacent cities.\n\nOne of the \"tricks\" is that each link can only be owned (and used) by one payer, so it is possible to guess an opponent's secret objective and block him.\n\n",

      "description": "The Patapon tribe were once an incredible force to be reckoned with, guided by their god, Almighty.  No foe was too great, no treasure out of reach, as they searched for the fabled Earthend.  However, these days are long gone, and the Patapons are now a shadow of their former selves.  Take on the role of Almighty, and restore the Patapons to their former glory!\n\n<i>Patapon</i> is a hybrid of a rhythm game such as PaRappa the Rapper and a strategy game with unit management such as Advance Wars.  Players control 'Almighty', the Patapons' god, as they guide them in search of Earthend.  This is done with the Circle, X, Square and Triangle buttons - each button corresponds with a different type of drum beat.  By pressing different sets of four beats, the Patapons will repeat the beat, and then perform the action, such as advancing, retreating or attacking.  If the player continues to perform beats without messing up, they enter 'Fever' Mode, which makes the Patapons perform their actions stronger and faster.\n\nBy collecting assorted items, such as meat and wood, and spending Ka-ching (the game's currency) players can create new Patapon units at the Tree of Life.  These units can then be prepared for battle before the player enters a stage, to give them better armor, shields, and weapons, which will help them fight more effectively against their foes.",

      "description": "Although <i>Mount&Blade: Warband</i> is called a stand-alone expansion pack to Mount&Blade, it is more of an enhanced remake of the original.\n\nAs stated, the core single player experience is unchanged to the original. <i>Mount&Blade: Warband</i> still is open-ended, nonlinear and focuses on realistic medieval warfare, combining character development elements with strategy management, exploration of the game world, and full real-time combat. Again the playing field is two-fold with an overhead map of the country where the player only sees figurative representations of castles, towns, own as well as enemy armies, etc., and the 3D real-time battles with up to a total of 150 units on the battlefield.\n\nBoth single and multiplayer modes feature improved graphics with motion-capture animations and more detailed textures. Combat itself has also been slightly altered with improved mechanics for soldier morale and the ability to use most throwing weapons in close combat.\n\n<b>New Faction and Diplomacy Features</b><br>\nTo the several different non-player character (NPC) kingdoms of the original, a new faction (the Sarranid) has found its way into the game which includes an expansion of the map with a new desert region for the player to explore and conquer. New gameplay mechanics include the ability to become king and create a new faction including convincing lords of other factions to become the players vassals. The player may also upgrade own companions to vassals and grant them lands (applies only to creating a new faction). In addition to becoming king, the player may now also marry a lady (or a lord, if playing a woman) through poetry or bravery, which will open up a whole new range of diplomatic possibilities, if the player is in ownership of a castle or town.\n\nSince the player still has total freedom to do as they wish, several new types of quests are waiting to be found and solved, many new companions are waiting in the taverns and a horde of new equipment to be collected or bought.\n\n<b>Multiplayer</b><br>\nMultiplayer is a new feature previously unavailable in the vanilla version. The game expands many aspects of the core game, improves the overall graphics and features multiplayer for up to 64 people (or bots) in which they can fight their 3D battles in the game modes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Conquest, Battle, and Siege. Each mode is class-based and the player has to decide whether the player wants to fight as archer, cavalry or infantry. The class choice influences the gear the player starts with, but as in the single player game, the player can always pick up what lies on the ground. Another way to get better gear is to buy it after each death with the money earned through killing enemies.",

The gameplay mechanics are the same as with other <i>Angry Birds</i> games, where the goal in each of the levels is to take out all of the pigs with the allocated amount and types of Angry Birds. The space and gravity mechanics from Angry Birds: Space are also implemented.\n\nFor this edition the birds have been given a <i>Star Wars</i> character makeover: Red Bird is Luke Skywalker, Yellow Bird is Han Solo, Pink Bird is Princess Leia, Big Red Bird takes the role of Chewbacca, Black Bird becomes Obi Wan Kenobi and Blue Bird is a rebel pilot. In addition to the cosmetic changes, the birds also get specific abilities based on what character they are: Red Bird gets a lightsaber, Yellow Bird gets a blaster etc. The Pigs are cast into the roles of the various bad guys of the <i>Star Wars</i> films such as Jawas, Stormtroopers and Darth Vader.\n\nAs with the characters, each level is based on parts of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, appearing in the order that they do in the film. Each level gets introduced with a <i>Angry Birds</i>-style introduction.",

      "description": "<i>Anomaly 2</i> is a reverse tower defense game. The player assumes the role of commander of a convoy and has to safely guide it to the mission objective. The game is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where humans fight against an alien infestation.\n\nIt is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and maintains its core gameplay elements: tactical view, squad screen and battle view. Tactical view is for planning and setting optimal squad path. Squad screen for buying, selling, upgrading or changing order of units. Battle view for directly controlling commander on the battlefield and placing special abilities, like repair that heals units, or aim that focuses squad fire on a single selected tower.\n\nThere are three important additions in <i>Anomaly 2</i>. The first one is the ability to morph units into their second mech form. Mech form grants different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The second addition is the inclusion of new and more sophisticated types of enemies, units and abilities. For example one new tower absorbs squad fire and if its meters is completely full it will transform into a stronger tower. The last one is a multiplayer mode where one player controls the towers and the other one the convoy. That means that one player plays a tower defense game and the other one tower offense.",

These four elemental giants (forest, mountain, ocean, and swamp giants) work in a symbiotic manner, as do their abilities. Each may bring unique plant and animal life, as well as minerals, all of which may be upgraded with aspects (i.e. bonuses). When food is available, humans may begin to settle and grow. How these humans evolve will greatly depend on the benefits bestowed by these giants within the borders of a human settlement. If they grow too greedy, they will start attacking other human settlements, to which, the giants may unleash their terrible powers of nature to punish them.",

      "description": "Battle Worlds: Kronos is a futuristic turn-based strategy game with gameplay similar to the Battle Isle series.\n\nSimilar to other turn-based strategy games like the Battle Isle series or Panzer General the battle ground is partitioned into small hexagons used for movement and attack distance calculation. You can issue two commands to each unit during a round; the possible commands can be determined by two icons on the lower right of a unit: \"Move\" for moving a unit, \"Attack\" for attacking, or \"Joker\" for any of the former or performing a special action (like deploying some artillery units or putting down mines). For example heavy units will have one Attack and one Joker action, making them quite slow, but allowing them to attack twice if they don't have to move. A scouting unit on the other hand would have two joker actions, making it possible to explore and retreat in a single turn.\n\nDamage is calculated by the unit's attack power against that certain type of enemy class and the damage the attacking unit has already taken, so the damage caused by a unit with only a few health points left will also be minimal.  Especially for slow units there a various types of transporters (by land, water or air) which can be used to get your units to the war zone a bit faster. Every time your unit has been involved in a fight the unit will get experience and level up after receiving 5 experience points. The experience can be used to upgrade the unit (e.g. for improved firepower or ignoring movement restrictions) or simply to restore some of the unit's health. Units will defend themselves, but only if their own attack range lies within that of the attacker - making long-range units vulnerable to close-range attacks and vice versa.\n\nEnemy buildings (radar stations, HQs or factories for building and repairing units) can be captured by attacking them with an infantry unit, making infantry units quite important for a mission's success - and making it possible to end a fight early by capturing the enemy HQ. The 3D view can be zoomed from a close up of the units to a strategic map showing only symbols.\n\nThe game features both a singleplayer campaign and multiplayer maps, with multiplayer games saved on a central server for a making turns similar to correspondence chess, i.e. the opponent does not have to be online for your turn. The game may then be resumed at any time, however you may also watch your enemies movements live.",

      "description": "<i>Space Hulk</i> is a strategy game based on the 1989 board game of the same name (which is set in the <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> universe). In contrast to the <i>Space Hulk</i> games of the nineties, this product aims for a exact conversion of the original <i>Sins of Damnation</i> campaign. There is no plot and the campaign consists of twelve not interconnected missions (plus three tutorials) in which a Space Marine squad fights against aliens, the only enemy type. \n\nCombat is turn-based: in each round, every marine has four action points which can be used for actions like moving, attacking or turning (the viewing direction is important for combat, partly because the majority of time is spent in tight corridors); more costly are overwatch (the marine automatically fires if an alien enters the line of sight) and guard (improves defense in melee combat). At least in the easier difficulty level, the player also has a few general action points which can be used for any soldier. While there are multiple types of soldiers with different weaponry (e.g. melee or flame throwers) which have their advantages and disadvantages, the aliens aliens (which come in two flavors: Genestealers and Broodlords) are completely melee based. The result of fights rely on dice rolls and are deadly for one combatant - there are no hit points or character statistics. Another element taken from the original are \"blips\": waves which show the location of aliens, but not their quantity or type.",

      "description": "<i>SMITE</i> is a free-to-play MOBA with gameplay very similar to games like Heroes of Newerth, League of Legends and Dota 2. In <i>Smite</i>, players control gods from all kinds of religions: Greek, Roman, Chinese, Egyptian, Norse, Hindu, Mayan, Japanese and Celtic gods.\n\nSMITE is a typical MOBA where in the main mode Conquest, there are two teams of five players, both having a base on the corners of the map. Each base has three paths leading to it, which must all be defended in order to halt the approaching enemies. After a very short time, AI-controlled minions start spawning and following all three paths. These minions serve as support for the players, mainly used as cannon fodder for pushing the enemy towers.\n\nAll three paths are defended by two towers and a phoenix, which must be destroyed in order to advance to the enemy base and let ally minions through. After a team has pushed through one of more lanes, the enemy titan has to be killed in order to win the game. Between these set paths is a so called jungle, where visibility is a lot lower and several buff camps are located. These jungles can be used to quickly switch lanes and flank enemies. Or help out teammates where needed.\n\nAside from Conquest, SMITE also has the modes: Arena, which features no lanes; Siege, which features two lanes; Clash, which features two lanes but with a much smaller jungle than Siege; Assault, which features one lane with randomly selected gods; Joust, with one lane but being able to choose a god yourself; and a Match of the Day which switches game type, gods and conditions daily. Aside from this multiplayer modes, there's also the tutorials, a practice mode with other players against bots, and the ability to start custom games. In-game events called adventures mostly feature a new temporary mode. In the past these were Mario-style racing with carts, Capture the Flag, an RPG like PVE mode, and a Corrupted Arena, the Arena game mode but with the map gradually changing during the game.\n\nAll players start with a base pool of gold, of which the amount varies per game mode. This gold can be used for buying items for the current battle. More gold is earned over time, and by killing enemies and enemy minions. Players also gain exp with kills and destroying towers and phoenixes. This exp is used to upgrade the four skills of the god. As with all other MOBA's, skill progression and bought items reset upon the end of the game. So every new game you'd have to start from scratch.\n\nUnlike most MOBA's with their isometric views, this game uses a third-person view. Also, instead of using the mouse to move the character, this game features the WASD keys for moving the character.",

The single-player mode takes place in a world history museum. The evil villain, Lord Crowley-Mesmer, wants to take over the world and the player tries to stop him. Single-player gameplay not only revolves about killing enemy worms, but also about rescuing friendly ones and puzzling a way through the level using ninja ropes, jumping and placing metal bars.\n\nMultiplayer gameplay is much like any other <i>Worms</i> game. Both players get a set of Worms. These worms are randomly placed in a map. The goal is to kill the enemy worms before the enemy can do the same. Multiplayer can be played local and through internet. The game features 65 different weapons and utility items, of which ten weapons are new to the series. Among those ten is the ray gun to teleport to other parts of the map. \n\nPlayers can customize their worms with various items, including head wear and handheld items. Clans for the multiplayer mode can be created and joined and players can create their own maps to play on. Maps can be customized by choosing the background, items that spawn in the map, where water spawns, etc.",

Whereas the previous game, Talisman: Prologue was focused on single player, this version features multiplayer for up to four players (or AI opponents) locally or online.\n\nThe objective of the game is to retrieve the Crown of Command, a powerful magical artifact that allows its bearer to become the ruler of the land of the Talisman. With it a player can cast command spells that forces other players out of the game. The artifact is located in the centre of the board but before going there players need to build up their characters so that they are powerful enough to handle the inner region. Each character has strength, craft, fate and life values as well as different special abilities. \n\nThe game is turn based and players move around the board by dice rolls. After moving they can then either encounter another character or follow the instructions, which often involves drawing an adventure card. When encountering another character the player can either attack or use a special ability. If the opposing character is killed the player can take any of its objects, followers and gold. Adventure cards involve events, encounters with enemies such as animals, dragons, monsters and spirits as well as strangers.",

Players can choose between a variety of plague types, including Virus, Fungus, Bacteria etc. Aside from the official types, players can also create and share custom plagues via the Steam Workshop.\n\nPlayers start by initially infecting a country of their choosing. After that, the player must upgrade their plague in order to infect more people, develop different symptoms, and develop resistance to cure attempts that will gradually take place. These factors will change depending on the plague type, and the difficulty setting. The game can end for various reasons: if the plague destroys the world, if the plague is cured, or if there are survivors after all other victims have been killed. \n\nThe game offers four difficulty settings, Casual, Normal, Brutal and Mega Brutal. The game supports cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.",

      "description": "<i>Bloons TD 5</i> is the fifth main tower defence game in the <i>Bloons</i> franchise. The aim is to guard the exit of a track by using several different units with different abilities. These can be upgraded in the Monkey Lab in four domains to be optimized for the situation, or the player's strategy. There are two different upgrade trees, instead of one in the previous games. Towers can also be enhanced with special abilities. Unlike similar games, the chosen upgrades are permanent, maintained across sessions and cannot be reversed.\n\nThe game has a quirky style and units are based around monkeys. New towers for this version include a ninja monkey and a sniper monkey. The enemy waves consist entirely of rows of colourful balloons (bloons), but with different abilities affecting speed or the way they explode. By progressing, experience is earned to unlock new units. This version adds a reverse mode, a cooperative mode, an extreme difficulty level, random missions, daily challenges and special missions. There are many new enemy types such as regrowth bloons and after completing a track it can be played in a freeplay mode. The game uses two currencties: Monkey Money (in-game) and NK Coins (premium).",

This time the player rules the island from the 19th to the 20th century, starting as governor for the colony before releasing the grip of the motherland. During the years two world wars and the cold war era have to be mastered. There are other islands nearby and also some super powers, which may allies, trading partners (for the new trade fleet) or dangerous foes. As the time passes by new technologies and buildings become available, while other buildings are obsolete and need to be replaced to stay up to date. \n\nOne of the new resources in the game is the own extended family, which are also present on the map. These family members can be used as generals, managers or diplomats. Most of the other resources have to be discovered first, using expeditions which will explore the island and may find new resources or ancient ruins. An important addition in this release are the cooperative and competitive multiplayer games for up to four players. ",

      "description": "<i>Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist</i> is a 2015 simulated card game based off the Yu-Gi-Oh! Franchise.  The first Yu-Gi-Oh! game to be played on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, <i>Legacy of the Duelist</i> features over 6,600 playable cards and 90 characters, the most of any previous installment. The game allows you to play in various game modes all which require you to create powerful decks filled with monsters, magic and trap cards in order to defeat your opponent in battle.\n\nThe story campaign of <i> Legacy of the Duelist</i> allows you to relive popular battles between characters in the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime. You begin by choosing one of the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds, Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V) and then following in chronological order of the TV show you begin to duel numerous characters.  Each victory against the opponent rewards you with 3 cards from the opposite deck, a deck recipe so you can recreate the opponents deck, and Duel Points (DP).  DP are used in the card shop to purchase any one of the 24 booster packs in game.  Once you complete any story mission the game allows you to participate in a Reverse Duel where you take control of your opponents deck and battle with it.  Completing and winning in all of a characters duel will unlock a challenge deck; allowing you to face that character in a match of better cards and higher difficulty.\n\nBattle Pack mode contains both Draft Play and Sealed Play. In Battle Pack mode, the player begins by purchasing one of the three Battle Packs in game: Epic Dawn, War of the Giants and War of the Giants - Round 2.  Then, if playing in Draft Play, the player is given 3 rounds to draft cards in order to create a 40 card deck.  Sealed mode will automatically create the deck for you.  Afterwards the player takes their newly created deck and uses it online to battle other players.  Completing a match with 3 wins (or 3 losses), will give you the option to add those cards into your card trunk.\n\nThe online component of the game allows you to duel against players from around the world. You can play in both Ranked and Unranked matches and each have different rules.  <i>Legacy of the Duelist</i> adheres to the banlist of the physical card game.  This means that certain cards deemed too powerful have been either completely banned or limited to 1-2 copies during duels by Konami. Playing online with Unranked rules allows you to ignore the banlist and use any cards you want in your deck.  Meanwhile playing in Ranked will do the opposite and you prevent you from using the banned cards in gameplay. \n\nThe game also features trophies and achievements, and the paid DLC allows you to purchase a story battle, reverse battle, and obtain special custom recipes not in game.",

Even if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\n\nThe game offers three planets: Desert, Frozen and Gas Giant. Colonists include workers, biologists, engineers, medics and guards. Bots that can be manufactured include a carrier bot, a constructor bot and a driller bot. The colony can be threatened by meteors, sandstorms or solar flares.",

      "description": "<i>Ironclad Tactics</i> is a mix of real-time strategy and card games. First, you choose twenty cards to form a deck. The cards include fighting units (mainly giant robots or American Civil War infantry), tactic cards (which affect, for example, unit movement), weapons (to be placed in the robot's hands) and other parts which affect unit health, speed or attack values. Then you play a map with those card. A map consists of five straight lanes where you play your units, usually at the left side of the map. The units walk towards the right, shooting at enemies as they move; if an unit reaches the enemies' side of the screen, it scores VP (Victory Points) to its owner. Whomever reaches 8 VP first wins.\n\nDuring the battles themselves, at any given time, you have five cards to choose from. In order to play a card, you need to spend AP (Action Points), which are slowly replenished with time. In some maps, you can increase the AP replenishing rate by holding strategic positions in the map. But there is a catch: as time passes, your cards continuously scroll sideways. If a card leaves the screen, it is replaced by a new one chosen at random from your deck. You almost never have enough AP to play your whole hand, so the game becomes a hectic affair where you must make quick decisions about what cards to play and where before they vanish from your hand.\n\nAs you win missions, you are rewarded with graphic novel style cut-scenes which tell the story of an alternate American Civil War with giant steam powered robots, and you unlock new cards. Cards are also unlocked by reaching special goals within each map.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer modes: a cooperative story mode and two competitive modes.",

      "description": "<i>Unholy Heights</i> is a strategy game in which the player takes control over Satan himself. He has settled down and opened an apartment block for monsters. This part of the game is typical hotel management: potential tenants come looking for a room and, if accepted, pay a regular rent. This rent can be reinvested into furniture for the individual rooms to increase the tenant's satisfaction or become more attractive for stronger/richer monsters. Certain furniture types may also increase the tenant's combat statistics. The rent can be adjusted which has a direct influence on the satisfaction. The personalities of each tenant should be taken into consideration while expanding, e.g. certain monster types dislike each other. On the other hand, male and female tenants of the same type may result in result and offspring.\n\nThe second big aspect of the game is combat against adventurers which try to steal Satan's gold. This can be prevented by knocking on the tenants' doors and send them to fight. Here it is important to keep the monsters' statistics into consideration, e.g. ranged attackers should not be sent to the frontlines (which is determined by the order they are sent out). The attacks are wave based, i.e. the attackers stand in line and only two opponents fight each other in melee until one is out. Damaged monsters can be ordered to return to their room. Because monsters leave for work, they may not be available.\n\nMost attacks are initiated by posting a quest on the job board. Those are not only a source of income, but are also required for game progression. It starts with one floor and four apartments, but eventually the player has to manage four floors with overall 16 rooms. Some attacks start without player intervention.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version introduces some minor changes such as more save slots, a quick tenant overview and the possibility to name the tenants' children.",

      "description": "After PC (2011) and Xbox (2014) releases, <i>World of Tanks</i> got ported to PlayStation 4 platform. The full game is free to download and play and does not require PlayStation Plus subscription, only a PSN account to download it and play it online.\n\nThe game features over 350 different tanks from five different classes (light tank, medium tank, heavy tank, tank destroyer, and artillery) and seven nations (USA, Germany, UK, USSR, France, Japan, and China) and supports 30-player online mode pitting 15 against 15 players. PlayStation 4 release features new content that was not previously available on PC or Xbox 360/One releases, some of which include custom maps, custom tanks, and custom vehicle skins.\n\nThe launch for PlayStation 4 platform, however, started with around 130 tanks from only three nations (USA, Germany, and USSR) with the rest being gradually added. Beta exclusive US tanks which can be found in one's Garage include T1E6-PS with elite camouflage and M22 Locust-PS adorned with a color scheme of the original PlayStation console. PlayStation Plus subscribers will additionally get access to an exclusive German premium tank, Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. J PS adorned with a unique darkened camouflage featuring a \"pinup girl\" livery.\n\nLaunch release also features these two time-exclusive multiplayer maps:\n<ul>\n<li> Skorpion Pass - set in North Africa during WWII, at the time of release this is the largest map created for the game\n<li> Ruinberg - set in war-torn European town better suited for urban warfare, with fields that allow for outmaneuvering enemy tanks\n</ul>\nThe console version of <i>World of Tanks</i> feels like a completely different game in comparison to PC version. Aside from various aesthetic designs, different settings and presentation, same and different maps, things worth mentioning include:\n<ul>\n<li> Console version doesn't have separate download releases per regions and during startup player can connect to either US, European, or Asian server. This in turn also means the same Hall of Fame ladder on the Internet features all players independent on the region (while PC one has different for Europe, US, etc.).</li>\n<li> When creating Platoon to play with other players on the same team, console version supports up to 5 players in a platoon, while PC only 3 (PC, does however, include an option to create a platoon during actual gameplay by prompting another player to join your platoon).</li>\n<li> PC version allows upgrade of individual tank element (turret, caterpillar, cannon, engine, and radio) while console version has pre-set packages that are researched and purchased which include several of those elements at once and don't offer individual element upgrade.</li>\n<li> While PC version relies on keyboard and allows players to type to their platoon, team, or even enemy players, console version relies on a bunch of pre-set messages (some of which are also available on PC version), the chat is available in both version though there are differences.</li>\n<li> Console version has only 1 crewman per tank, while on PC version that is branched out into driver, loader, gunner, etc., and the number of crew depends on the type of tank. Also, not all crew are compatible with all vehicle types, while on console version vehicle type doesn't matter, only nationality (i.e. German crewman can only be assigned to a German tank).</li>\n<li> Aiming at enemy tank on a console version outlines the tank based on where you're aiming at, telling you how big of a chance is for penetration of that area if you land a successful hit, while PC version just generally outlines a tank in green and doesn't show you whether you're bullet will bounce off or if you have a chance to penetrate its armor.</li>\n<li> Aiming an artillery on PC just shows a trajectory line, but on console it shows the time that bullet will travel to that place which can be as high as 3-4 seconds on larger distances which plays a huge factor when enemy tank isn't completely static.</li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<i>XCOM 2</i> is a turn-based tactical strategy game and the sequel to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. <i>XCOM 2</i> takes place twenty years after the events of <i>Enemy Unknown</i>, where it is assumed the player lost the battle to save Earth. The aliens have taken over and the player must lead a small guerrilla force to retake the planet. In the strategy layer, the player must fly the Avenger, a mobile base, around the planet, bolstering the resistance and upgrading his ship.  In the tactical layer, a squad of soldiers must navigate multiple environments, dispatching aliens and completing objectives.\n\nJust like the previous game there is support for one-on-one online multiplayer games. Unlike <i>Enemy Unknown</i> that used fixed levels, <i>XCOM 2's</i> maps have portions that are randomly generated, for instance with objects and buildings, but the overall level design is always the same. Random generation is also applied to side missions, enemy placement and reinforcements. All buildings are destructible.",

In between missions, the player can build his base, upgrade existing and unlock new units, build structures and place turrets to protect against invading armies, and customize the army. During fights with other players the army gathers experience which can be used for upgrades, in addition to in-app purchases which allow you to do that faster, but for real money.\n\nThe battle consists of attacker's army truck approaching enemy base. The truck is filled with certain types of infantry units which can be summoned in exchange for ammunition which is used as a currency for the troops. The defender can do the same, but the defending army exits from the HQ building or the infantry barracks. The attacker's goal is to destroy the enemy HQ. Infantry on both sides will advance toward the enemy and along the way fires automatically. Destroyed enemy troops and structures often leave items which can be picked up and used in battle by the player. The items, among many others, include a rally flag which rallies ones troops, a dummy which forces enemy troops to fire at it instead of your troops, carpet bombing which summons bomber against selected area, a missile strike, tear gas which stuns enemy infantry for a short time, and more.",

The basic gameplay is similar to real-time strategy games as you can build structures such as factories, barracks, shipyards, and such, and produce various ground, aerial and naval units. You earn experience and medals through battles and victories, which in turn let you build new and more powerful units and structures. Players can purchase the in-game gold currency with real money which gives an edge in battles by being able to quickly purchase more powerful and useful items in the tech tree. As the title implies, the battles are waged on the islands, whether on your own island where you have to defend it against enemy AI or against a player, or when you are attacking and trying to overtake an enemy occupied island. Islands can also be expanded by building additional land mass connecting it with bridges, which gives you place for more structures.",

The concept is similar to the 1989 game Herzog Zwei. The player controls a battle mech which can morph from mech to aircraft and vice versa, able to engage in combat against aerial or ground units. The player controls this unit alone throughout the game and can freely move in any direction and fire at will. This is the arcade action shooter element of the game. \n\nEach match requires one team to take out enemy units and occupy the enemy base. Each player can produce units and defenses and can transport them to certain location on the map, bringing them closer to empty base buildings to be occupied. This is the real-time strategy element of the game. Allied units cannot be controlled nor issued commands as to where to go. They either protect against enemy units or head straight to the enemy base trying to take it, acting as minions as in ARTS/MOBA games.\n\nThe game has training levels that get you familiar with controls and what can be done on the battlefield. It lets you play in skirmish with AI controlled players, or players can go head to head in one-on-one or team based fights against other online players.",

The player creates his or her character which uses rings to summon different types of avatars the character can morph into. Throughout the game you can acquire different invocations which provide with new skills to aid you in combat. Two rings can be worn at the same time, providing different types of attacks and spells. Typical for the genre, Minions can be summoned. They are controlled by the AI and go after enemy structures. Characters also use consumables, accessed from a belt, and different types of weapons and gear stored in an inventory.\n\nThe game supports microtransactions and subscriptions which are not free, but give you advantage over other players. Character skins are also not free. The game supports solo online play or team play. The game often runs new seasons which only last for a certain amount of time.",

      "description": "<i>Hitman GO: Definitive Edition</i> is an enhanced version of the mobile title Hitman GO, updated for consoles and PC where it is the first version of the game for the platforms. Just like the original game it is a turn-based strategy title based on the <i>Hitman</i> franchise. Agent 47 needs to complete objectives using stealth in small diorama-like environments resembling a board game, with turn-based gameplay.\n\nThis version has the same amount of levels as the mobile version, where the game was launched with 68 levels and 23 more were added over time. These are divided over seven chapters. The levels of two chapters are inspired by the environments of two games in the series: Hitman: Blood Money and St. Petersburg Stakeout inspired by Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. The graphics have been enhanced and there are new controls. Unlike the mobile version there are no in-app purchases for hint packs, to unlock a full walkthrough, or to unlock the additional chapters right away before the required amounts of playing cards have been gathered. In this version hints are available at all times, but using them makes it impossible to get certain achievements/trophies.",

      "description": "<i>Sparkle: Unleashed</i> is the third iteration in the series and a slightly moderated game version of Sparkle and Sparkle 2 games. The main difference is that the cannon launching the ball is no longer static, and is instead placed at the bottom of the screen. The second thing is that the cannon cannot rotate and can launch balls only upwards like in <i>Space Invaders</i>. This approach requires more of a timing and following the trajectory as you are not able to hit the desired spot at any given time. Just as the previous two games, this version also features a background story with a world map that connects the levels into something more than just a puzzle game with sequenced number of levels. Marbles are still matched in three or more, and there is assistance for colorblind people which adds a different symbol inside the marble to mark certain color.",

      "description": "<i>Summon Night 6</i> is a turn-based fantasy RPG following the story of a young boy from Felusia world, Raj, who is making his due by collecting objects that are mysteriously falling from the sky and selling them to make a living. One day, the boy witnessed a rather unusual falling object, quite different from what he usually collects. The fallen object turns out to be a summoned person from Lindbaum named Magna. By listening of the man's story, Raj decided to help him return to his homeworld of Lindbaum. Some distance away from the point of impact, a girl names Am encountered yet another person fallen from Linbaum named Natsumi. The player can controls both protagonists in their separate stories and journeys until their stories start to intertwine. The battles are turn-based and viewed from 3rd-person perspective, with ability to shift camera view to top-down perspective for easier navigation on a multi-layered terrain. Regular weapon and magic attacks are available, depending on the character in question, and player can use various powerups and healing items. As the game title implies, the party characters can also summon various creatures to fight at your side. Special summoning attacks can even be chained between two or more party characters for a more powerful effect.",

      "description": "<i>Armello</i> is a board game like fantasy strategy game with animals as your main protagonists. As the king of Armello is slowly getting insane due to a plague called \"The Rot\", the four races he once united will try to claim the throne for themselves. You will be one of the contestants of the four playable races, with each race providing a male and a female character: wolves, rabbits, rats and bears.\n\nThere are four ways to win the game:\n<ul>\n<li>Kill the king in battle (King Slayer Victory)\n<li>Heal the king with four Spirit Stones (Spirit Stone Victory)\n<li>Kill the king with a rot value higher than the kings (Rot Victory)\n<li>If the king dies from it's illness or when both the king and and eventual attacker die, the player with the most prestige points wins (Prestige Victory)\n</ul>\nYou will move your character around the hexagonally tiled lands of Armello and accept quests, attack other players / enemies or search dungeons to gain points in one of several categories: attack, body, wits, spirit, gold, magic, prestige and rot. Prestige is worth a closer look, as it is not only necessary for the Prestige Victory, but the player with the highest prestige will also be able to choose from two \"King's Declarations\" that will affect all players each day.<br>\nAdditionally at the beginning of your turn you can stock up your card deck (depending on your wits value). The cards may contain equipment, one time bonuses or cards to harm another player's progress (like putting a \"Peril\" on a field your opponent will likely visit next turn or lower the income of one of his villages). Fights and perils will be decided by rolling dice (where their number depends on your points in the required category), but you may also \"burn\" some of your cards to get guaranteed results or use / equip them for bonuses.\n\nThe game is turn-based, with each player usually having 3 action points to spend. You cannot die permanently in the game, but in addition to being reset to your own clan's territory you will loose prestige and all remaining action points when doing so.\n\nApart from four short tutorial missions the game does not contain any campaign, but is focused on the board game aspect of the game including multiplayer support.",

      "description": "<i>Chroma Squad</i> is a Tactical RPG where five actors decide to start their own show and conquer the hearts of spectators, inspired by the Power Rangers television show. \n\nThe five actors record a few episodes in a season before getting involved in a boss fight, the Finale. Fights, combos and moves provide points, which are calculated in term of experience, spectators and fan power. Episodes cost money to produce (actors are getting payed, equipment is used), but each successful one can provide cash and items (dropped by villains) to ensure further combats and to buy or craft improvements. Between each episode, it is possible to change the marketing campaign, according to different strategies (retaining audience, getting more cash flow or fans).",

      "description": "<i>Aegis of Earth: Protonovus Assault</i> is set 50 years after the so-called \"Silent Apocalypse\": a catastrophe which brought monsters in the world which only have one thing in their minds - killing all remaining humans. Those are gathered in a few remaining cities powered by the new element altenite.\n\nIn its core, this game is a tower defense game: monsters attack the city in waves (in contrast to other genre brethren, they take the direct way) and are shot down by defense machines previously bought by the player. Of course there are different enemy types which are vulnerable to certain weapons. The speciality is that the cities are constructed as rings (there is an inner ring, an outer ring, another outer ring and so on). During battle, these rings can be rotated individually to meet the requirements of the current attack. When multiple weapons from different rings are perfectly aligned, they form a more powerful weapon. \n\nBetween attacks, there is an unlimited planning phase in which the player engages in city development: besides the obvious things to buy (more weapons, weapon upgrades) there are also other things to take care of, for example structures for refugees (a bigger population results in more tax income) or research of advanced weaponry. Later in the game the player will take control over multiple cities, including the option to jump back and forth via a world map.\n\nThe frame story is mostly told in dialogues between a cast of anime characters. The involved people are also present during battles and may trigger their special ability (there are six classes). However, the player has no direct influence what and which ability is activated; it mostly hinges on the character's focus level. An example for keeping focus high is the option to personally thank one team member after a mission.",

At each turn, you assign one action to each of the surviving crew.\n\nEach astronaut has a few hitpoints and a few dice which can be rolled to repair a module, generate research, gather resources which depend on the module he/she is at, or power a special ability which varies with the crew member. Each action destroys one die, which can be regenerated by consuming food or by special actions. At the end of every turn you choose an additional crew action, whose effectiveness depend on the stress level of the astronauts.

      "description": "<i>Blackguards 2</i> is a turn-based tactical role-playing game that takes place three years after the original. Cassia of Tenos was the consort of Marwan, the First Kyrios of Mengbilla, until one day she was snatched from her bed and thrown to rot in the catacombs beneath the capital's arena. Frightened and clueless as to why she is deprived of her freedom, she soon finds out that the underground is a dangerous place, inhabited by venomous spiders and who knows what other manner of creatures. Her only companion is \"The Good Ruler\", a book on governing, which after countless reads has triggered a spark inside Cassia--she decided that she wants to rule, to see everyone bow before her, even if it's just for one day.\n\nThe game is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game <i>The Dark Eye</i>, and borrows a lot of mechanics and the setting from it. The player joins Cassia as she escapes from her prison and tries to conquer the Emirate of Mengbilla. The game is almost identical to the original <i>Blackguards</i> in terms of graphics and gameplay. Even more, all the main heroes besides Cassia are the player's companions in the first title. However, there are significant changes to the skill tree and level progression since the base values can't be upgraded, instead the focus turns to a wide array of special abilities, and a four-tier system for weapon talents, talents and spells. While weapon talents can be increased point by point from 0 to 100, the effects improve only when a certain threshold is reached (the next tier). On the other hand, simple talents and spells can be upgraded only four times, from tier 1 to tier 4. Travelling on the world map is now less about exploration and solving quests, and more about conquering different towns and points of interest. The world map plays as a sort of <i>Risk</i>-like board game, in which Cassia needs to take over these settlements one by one until the entire emirate is under her control. Conquering a specific location will give the player certain bonuses and possibly new types of mercenary units. After a few victories, the enemy will launch a counterattack which, if not defeated, will lead to losing the location and all of its attached bonuses. If the main heroes are not in the region, most of these side battles will be fought by bands of mercenaries which, depending on what parts of the world map were conquered, can include swordfighters, spearmen, archers, as well as an assassin, a mage and a black ogre. Their skill increases if specific locations with bonuses are under the player's control.\n\nThe battles that take place on hex maps remain the core of the game. They are usually triggered via the world map, however there are some tied directly to the story as well. In all hex battles the player can employ different tactics using the heroes' individual abilities, spells and the surroundings, including traps, difficult terrain and wildlife. When defending a territory there is an initial phase where different traps, obstacles and barrels of oil can be placed around in strategic places in order to slow down the enemy's advance. While Cassia and her three companions are the main heroes during the entirety of the game, the player has the option of using a couple of mercenaries to fight alongside them in most battles. As mentioned before, defensive battles are usually fought by mercenaries only. Every participant in combat receive an initiative that determines when their turn comes during a round. When it's their time to act they can perform either a long move, a short move plus an action, or just an action. Among possible actions are doing a melee attack, a ranged attack, drinking a potion, casting a spell, applying poison to a weapon or interacting with an object on the field. Winning a battle rewards the player with adventure points (AP) and loot. The former can be used later to improve the individual stats of Cassia and her three companions.\n\nBetween fights the party can travel to any of the towns under their control or set up camp in the wild. The towns are a good source of information and rare items. Basic equipment can be found in the camp as well, along with Garalor and Galderan, whose knowledge only allows the player to learn specific maneuvers or abilities. During these digressions, Cassia can talk to other characters to learn something about their past or improve the bond between them. To the back of the camp there's an area with cages where prisoners are held and can be interrogated using multiple dialogue options. The outcome of such interrogations as well as other decisions the player has to take may change how certain battles play out and how people will view Cassia as she takes over the emirate.",

      "description": "<i>Battle of the Bulge</i> is a turn-based wargame simulating a World War II battle at the Ardennes from December 16, 1944 and January 25, 1945  (the game does not cover the German counter-offensive and ends on December 28, though). The player takes control over either side and tries to lead it to victory.\n\nIn established wargame fashion, the map is divided into different zones (no fixed shape) and the units are represented as icons. During each turn, which randomly covers between 30 and 180 minutes, each unit can move (depending on the unit type and conditions between one and three zones) once. After movement is concluded, all active units (all which the player moved or clicked on) on a field with enemy units attack. The result is based on various variables and determines which side controls the zone.\n\nThere are no neutral zones. This is important to keep in mind because supplies play a vital role: when a unit has no path of friendly zones towards a friendly edge map at the end of the day, it is considered isolated and can't be used during the next day. The parameters of the map, e.g. the weather and replacements, are based on the real conditions; additionally the game also automatically applies bonuses/disadvantages or restrictions during specific days. For example, the Axis have a fuel shortage from December 21 forward (one randomly chosen mechanized unit is isolated each day) and the Allied can't cross the river Meuse until the Axis move towards it.\n\nVictory depends on the accumulation of victory points. Those are rewarded for destroying enemy units; the Axis also gains them for holding certain areas at the end of the day. In turn, the Allied gain points for every isolated Axis unit at the end of December 28. The exact winning conditions change depending on the chosen scenario and current day and are checked at the end of each day (except in the Bitter End scenario). The Axis can also win when they manage to take and supply a zone west of the Meuse until December 19.\n\nBesides the usual hot-seat mode, the game (on iOS since version 2.14) also features cross-platform play-by-mail multiplayer.",

      "description": "<i>Elite: Dangerous</i> is a game that combines space exploration, combat and trading in a futuristic setting. It is the fourth game in the <i>Elite</i> series and the sequel to the 1995 Frontier: First Encounters. It is set in an open world based on the real Milky Way and it is persistent in the way that it started in the year 3300 when it was launched in 2014 and time runs in sync with ours. As in the previous games the player starts with a small ship and a limited amount of 'credits' and needs to make a name by exploring an enormous galaxy said to contain 400 billion star systems. There are both noble and infamous paths to follow with many different types of jobs involving bounty hunting, exploring, fighting, mining, piracy, smuggling or trading, but always with the goal of acquiring capital to invest in larger ships, advanced equipment and cargo bays to store goods. There is a laws and crime system in place tied to a reputation. The game has fines and bounties, but players can also buy insurance.\n\nWhile the single-player of the previous games remains, there is an important persistent element as the choices of the different players across their own games impact the larger open-ended narrative. The game also needs a constant internet connections as the economy is based on the global player action by buying or selling resources and how the three factions (Alliance, Empire and Federation) interact through Power Play: galaxy-wide faction-based challenges. There are cycles in place that are re-calculated every week based on extensive systems involving financial, political and social weight that can be directly influenced by players, for instance by pledging to or withdrawing support from powers. Expansion on the map can be achieved in the same way. A Solo mode can be played to never encounter a human player, but there is also real multiplayer, either the Open Play mode as a large free-for-all or working cooperatively, or the Private mode to only play with a select number of friends. During space travel players encounter stars, planets, moons, black holes and asteroid fields.\n\nSpace flight is a simulation in the sense that there are a lot of controls to master and interpreting the HUD with afterburner, cargo, communications, compass, docking, fuel, heat, hull, landing gear, lasers, power, scanning, shields, speed, transactions etc. Travelling is done through standard space flight, hyperspace jumps or super cruise. During fights many types of manoeuvres are supporting through engine boosts, pitch, roll, throttle, thrust and yaw. Ships are customized through large amount of modules such as drives, fuel scoop, fuel tank, heat sink launcher, life support, power distributor, power plant, sensors, shield generator, weapons etc.\n\nThe later released spin-off Elite: Dangerous - Arena was integrated into the main game for free as an additional option in the launcher.",

      "description": "<i>Nowa-111</i> is a sci-fi themed turn-based game set in alien worlds. The main mission is to restore the flow of time by searching out the scientists lost in the aftermath of the Universe's Greatest Science Experiment. The game is divided into sectors, each with a few individual missions. Each mission requires finding all the scientists and reaching the extraction point by navigating \"Nova\" spaceship. The labyrinth is inhabited by various enemy forms of life, including mutated astrobiological creatures and robots. \n\nAdditionally, numerous obstacles may be encountered, for example, falling stalactites or one way wind tunnels. The duel uses a turn-based system, where the player may move, perform or avoid attacks. The board view uses a fog of war system, showing only the closest area. The game expands with each level, allowing to use new weapons, extras and abilities.\n\nAs for the story, once upon a spacetime, there existed a team of 111 brilliant scientists, who lived together in a simple turn-based world. They were interested in expediting their scientific research, and thus began developing the Universe's \"Greatest Science Experiment\" which was theorized to unlock \"real-time\". All was fine until the science experiment resulted in a cosmic real-time/turn-based vortex that mashed the two unlikely worlds together. \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Trulon: The Shadow Engine</i> is a retro turn-based RPG with a card deck system, based on a fantasy universe by Johan Lillbacka. You will control a party of up to four characters, united in trying to find the cause of a strange illness. The game world is divided into two larger countries: the Kingdom of Tripudia, a country very close to nature where you are from, and Maelon, a industrialized country with \"debitors\" instead of citizens.\n\nThe game's RPG and fight mechanics are based on cards which may be found after fights or in chests. Each character has three slots to equip \"mechanism\" cards like additional health or special moves during offensive attacks. \"Tactics\" cards are used during fights; each character can equip as many of them as desired (though some of them are character specific). When a fight begins each character will start with up to five slots with randomly chosen cards from your deck; during the fight one card will be stocked up at the beginning of the character's round until the character's deck is out of cards. Additionally you will always have a basic attack card and one random joker card, restocked at the next character's move if used. The cards can be special attack cards (e.g. for attacking all enemies or for additionally boosting your damage), spells (e.g. magic attacks, stat modifications or healing), movement cards (e.g. for an additional turn in the current round or defense boosts) and deception cards (only usable by the spy).\n\nSome of the cards cost \"Gaudium\" or \"Dolorum\", which are the magical energies of the world. While health is restored after each fight, Gaudium and Dolorum is not and has to be refilled by collecting respective orbs. For successful fights you will gain experience, on level ups the character stats will automatically be improved. If you loose a fight you will be reset to the situation directly before the fight.\n\nThe game features a mix of three-dimensional environments with 2D sprite characters. Conversations, exploration and fights will all take place in the same view, however for fights the game will switch into a turn-based mode where you cannot change your card deck any more. The statically placed enemies can be seen and avoided if desired. In addition to the exploration areas there is a world map for traveling; quest locations like villages are highlighted and can be entered here. Random events on the world map may present you some enemies for grinding or chests with additional cards, however like in the exploration areas you are free to ignore the enemies (or the complete event).",

      "description": "<i>Uno</i> is an electronic adaptation of the classic card game. It can be played locally against AI opponents or in multiplayer locally or online. The classic rules are carried over as the first player of four participants to play all cards and empty the hand, wins the game. Also incorporated is a button to call \"Uno\" when down to a last card. Other players can challenge this if a player forgets to call it, forcing that player to draw two extra cards.\n\nOptional rules are Jump-In which allows a player to play a card out of turn to match a card that is played if it is completely identical (usually both number and colour). Playing a 7 allows that player to swap hands with any other player. Stacking allows players to stack penalties by playing the same type of card when Draw Two or Wild Draw Four is played, moving it on to the next player. These rules, along with some basic ones such as Force Play (a drawn card that can be played is played automatically), Draw-to-Match (drawing is continued until a card can be played instead of just one draw) and No Bluffing, can be disabled individually. It is also possible to set a score limit.\n\nSingle-player games can be played as solo matches or two-versus-two (partnering with a real player or the AI). In a cooperative game the cards of the two members are shown at all times so it is possible to provide help. For new players there is an interactive tutorial. Multiplayer supports a video chat so players can see each other. The base game can be expanded with DLC to add theme cards and new powers. These are based on other Ubisoft franchises such as Rayman or Just Dance. The game supports leaderboards, online lobbies and the overal results are tracked. A <i>Rabbids</i> theme is included right away.",
