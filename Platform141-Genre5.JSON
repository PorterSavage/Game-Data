Control your team of six players to pummel the opposing team into submission using only the ball and your team's unique skills. Each player has his own special attacks and each team has their own unique attributes.\n\nPlay the World Cup mode and take on teams from around the world to claim the championship. You play as the star USA team and must work your way through teams from countries such as England, Iceland, Japan, and more to finally take on the current ruling world champions, the Soviet Union.\n\nOr you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose.\n\nOr, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.",

      "description": "<i>Windjammers</i> is based on a real-life sport known as Saucer Tennis or Frisbee Tennis. You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly.\r\n\r\nThere are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.\r\n\r\nFor the futuristic touch, signature moves are added. To charge these special moves, you need to block, toss or lob the disc and then charge while the disc is in the air. These moves can be countered and sometimes they knock an opponent into the goal.\r\n\r\nTwo mini-games are included in-between levels: play fetch with a dog and Flying Disc Bowling.",

They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn <i>2020 Super Baseball</i> is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players.

There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn't mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles. \n",

You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help of the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.\n\nMulti-Play mode lets you \"link\" cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.",

      "description": "<i>Neo Turf Masters</i> is a golf game that offers play in three different countries. You can play in the US, Germany, and Japan. There are 18 holes per course, just like in real life, which totals to 54 holes. The game features a two-player versus mode and three single player modes. You can choose from one of six different characters, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Like many other golf games, you use an accurate click type of play, where you click in an overhead map where you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, and power. In Versus mode, you can earn \"super-clubs\" that can only be used once. These can also be traded between friends. \n\nThe ACA NeoGeo series release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One contain both the US and Japanese game versions, as well as Hi Score and Caravan modes which can all be launched from the main menu.",

One or two players can choose among 10 teams: France, Spain, U.S.A., Italy, Germany, Taiwan, United Kingdom, China, Japan and South Korea (in the European and Japanese versions. The U.S.A. version features local cities). The teams are rated in 1 to 9 points on four attributes (dunk, 3 point, speed and defense). Each game lasts two halves of 2 minutes each. The game ends if the player loses the first half, needing to spend a continue to play the second half.\n\nWhen on offense, the player can perform 2 or 3 point shots by pressing the A button. The B button is used to pass the ball. Pressing A and B together throws the ball high in the air, catching it meanwhile (by pressing A) causes the player to perform a dunk. When on defense, the player can jump and block by pressing A and cut off and steal by pressing B. A fantasy element is added to the game: a super shot meter is shown at the bottom of the screen for each team. As points are scored, the meter is filled. When the meter is full, the player can perform a super dunk by pressing A within the 3 points shot line, making the player jump 10 meters in the air.",

      "description": "The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.\n\nPlayers start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.\n\nSince the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. \n\nOther rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.\n\n\nIn a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.",

      "description": "<i>Stakes Winner</i> is a horse racing game. \n\nRaces can be entered by one or two players and involve eight horses struggling for victory; each of the eight horses (in the order which the game presents them in: White Heat, Hot Sand, Euro Union, Asian Hope, Brave Lady \u2014the sole female one\u2014, Be Silent, US Fighter, Sky Dancer) given for selection is characterized by three parameters (named \u00ababilities\u00bb in-game): speed, stamina, strength, all measured in stars from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. Rival horses are not available for selection to the player: their names are, for instance, the ominous- or hilarious-sounding \u00abMr Devious\u00bb, \u00abRed Vision\u00bb, \u00abSunk Star\u00bb, \u00abHelpMe\u00bb, \u00abOhMygod\u00bb, \u00abNutseater\u00bb. The names are also differentiated by being written all in capital letters the latter ones, normally the former.\n\nBefore the beginning of the race, while horses approach the starting point, the name of the circuit, course plan, prize money and circuit time record are displayed. During the race, the indicators on the screen are: the course plan (with a moving coloured circular indicator representing the position of each contender), the chronometric indication of time, the horse's energy bar with a line composed of three segments beside it: a red one (that means the horse is in its full strength), a yellow and a blue one (denoting lack of strength); a representation of the horse's face, which portrays its, more or less fatigued or strong status and how intensely it is running.\n\nThe game controls require the use of two buttons and the control stick or directional pad: one button controls the reins, for slight acceleration, which consumes a little of the horse's energies. The other one controls the whip, for sharp acceleration: this consumes the horse's force significantly. Should the energy be consumed entirely, racing will have to be given up for a while. Two rapid touches on the joystick or directional pad in the direction of travel allow to force away a horse blocking the player's road to victory; two rapid touches in the direction opposite to that of travel vigorously reduce speed. \n\nPower-up items represented by icons placed on the course may be taken during the race, raising one of the parameters of the horse by one for some time, giving a temporary boost in speed, or partially restoring the horse. Weather conditions change from time to time: the drizzle may be an obstacle, worsening the status of the terrain. A real second corresponds to two seconds in game (therefore, for instance, a one-minute race will last half a minute).\n\nAfter every stage, the track length, as well as the prize money awarded to the first three finishers are augmented. The series of levels are separated by training stages. If done successfully, training on the dirt or on the turf respectively increases the horse's stamina and speed, whereas training on or \u00abagainst\u00bb,the hill strengthens it. Success in training session is to be attained by pushing a button as rapidly as possible, while avoiding assorted obstacles and hindrances. The player can choose what type of training to opt for.\n\nRace courses proceed in the ensuing sequence: <ul>\n<li>Maidens</li>\n<li>Sapporo Juvenile</li>\n<li>Juvenile Stakes</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>2000 Guineas</li>\n<li>Derby Stakes (the $1.300.000 prize money is mistakenly displayed as \u00ab$ 130.000\u00bb)</li>\n<li>St. Leger (BC Classic in the original arcade game)</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>Japan Grandprix</li>\n<li>Emperor Spring Cup</li>\n<li>Champion Stakes</li>\n<li>St. Leger  (difficulty is now higher than the previous time)</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>Japan Cup</li>\n<li>Japan Grandprix (difficulty is this time higher than previously)</li>\n<li>The Arc The Triomphe</li></ul>\n\nThe game is identical to the original one in all of its fundamental aspects, save for a number of modifications to minor details: continues are still named \u00abcredits\u00bb (four of them are given: it is possible to select a different horse when continuing the game using a credit after game over) and their quantity is indicated, likewise in arcade games, at the bottom of the screen (although the flashing \u00abInsert coin\u00bb on the opening screen followed by \u00abPush P1 start !\u00bb has been replaced with \u00abPush P1 or P2 start !\u00bb).\n\nWhile the original game was entirely in Japanese (except for race names, given an English translation), the console version, despite not having been released outside of Japan, can be said to be in English (conversely, now race course names have a Japanese translation next to the English name); money prizes are now in dollars rather than in yen, and remarkably changed in value: whereas YPN 5300 were the reward in the arcade version, $540000 are awarded to the winner of a race. Initially, nothing but crossing the finish line in the first place allowed progression in the game; in the console conversion finishing in the first three places guarantees advancement to the next race.\n\nHorse energy is named \u00abpower\u00bb in the Neo Geo version, adhering to the original game, while in the Wii version it was renamed to \u00ablife\u00bb; furthermore, in the Neo Geo version the blue and red segments are shown inverted beside the energy bar. The console version presents fours levels of difficult: easy, normal, hard, MVS.",

The authorities have decided to allow the players on the pitch to win by any means including fighting and using weapons to attract the fans back. Eight countries of seven players which include England, Germany, Spain, USA, Japan, Brazil, Korea and Italy compete in a league to be the best in the world. There are now only two stadiums in the world, an astro-turf pitch in Japan and a metallic surface in San Francisco. Instead of the plastic ball used today, the ball is now a metal nuclear powered sphere.\n\n<i>Soccer Brawl</i> is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing a small part of the pitch. The joystick is used to move the players while one fire button passes or heads the ball, the other button punches a player or shoots the ball. The length of time the button is held down determines the power of the shot. Hold it down till the power meter fills and a super shot is initiated knocking down anyone who gets in the way.",

      "description": "<i>NBA 2K14</i> is an installment in the 2K Sports NBA 2K series based on the 2013-2014 NBA season.  The game features a number of new improvements and features from the previous entry NBA 2K13. <i>NBA 2K14</i> on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One contains upgraded graphics, animations, and different modes than the previous generation versions.\n\nIn Quick Game mode you get to pick a team to face off against the AI or another player. You can choose any team from the NBA and also famous teams from years past such as the '64-'65 Boston Celtics or the '93-'94 Chicago Bulls. For the first time in the 2K series, teams from the Euroleague (European Basketball League) are available for playing.  \n\nThe mode formerly known as MyPlayer has now been changed to MyCareer. In MyCareer you get to create a rookie and take him through his own NBA journey beginning with the NBA Rookie Showcase and the NBA Draft. This mode features scripted cut-scenes and allows interaction with your agent and general manager. Throughout the season you will be given chances to make your own decisions such as if you want to change your agent or which sponsor you would like to endorse. After every game you will be given Virtual Coins (VC) based on your performance. These coins can then be used on different things like improving your character's abilities or purchasing accessories and outfits.\n\nMyGM mode is the new franchise management mode. As the GM of a NBA team, you get to make all the decisions to attempt to bring your team to the top. Engaging in conversations with your owners, your players, and members of the press go a long way to improving the state of your franchise.  The way you answer questions to the press is very important; as lying to them will lower your credibility and in the end can lead to your firing. You have control of just about everything including player contract negotiations, free agent signings, and even prices of seats and food.\n\nMyTeam mode returns this time as the fantasy sports type game mode. You get to make a team using player cards gained from booster packs or bought with VC. You are given the chance to create a team name, location, and a logo. Your team can be taken online to compete against others and your stats can be seen on an online leaderboard.\n\nThe PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows versions contain a <i>LeBron: Path to Greatness</i> mode exclusive to those platforms, where you take control of the career of cover athlete LeBron James in his quest for multiple NBA championships.",

      "description": "<i>Madden NFL 25</i> for the PS4 and Xbox One was released later than Madden NFL 25 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, but it is largely identical to the initial platforms. This version uses a new Ignite engine instead of the Infinity Engine 2 engine for the PS3 / Xbox 360, which results in some visual enhancements such as smoother player interactions, more detailed grass, wear and tear of the field, more detailed jerseys and stadium textures, improved clothes physics, interactive 3D crowds that respond to the game's action etc. As most of the game is played from a heightened view, these mostly become apparent during replays or when zooming in.\n\nThere are some changes in the gameplay, for instance introducing running momentum for a more realistic simulation. Players can no longer sharply cut and turn, but need time to build speed, shift weight and change direction. The additional processing power is used to make offensive and defensive lines more distinct by crunching the player statistics, visible in the physics and AI through decision making and blocking interactions. Players will more often sense a certain strategy and react swiftly. All the game modes of the original version are present, and Ultimate Team even transfers over from PS3 to PS4 when upgrading.\n\nSpecific for the PS4 version is Remote Play for the PS Vita, hot-route capabilities through the controller's touchpad, and additional sharing features. The Xbox One version has a Smartglass companion app called CouchGlass. It can be used to call plays on defense and analyze the opponent's offense as a mini defensive coordinator.",

      "description": "<i>OlliOlli</i> is a 2D side-scrolling street skateboarding game with a pixel visual style. The player guides a skateboarder through different levels with many objectives to complete, such as reaching a certain score, performing a specific trick, catching air, pushing a limited amount of times, grinding specific objects, or getting certain landings. There are no enemies in the environment, so the focus is entirely on solo play performing tricks by jumping, doing spins, grabs, slides, flips, kicks, etc. The skater moves forward automatically and the player uses keys or buttons to spin left or right, jump, perform tricks, and also a key or button to control the landing. The amount of buttons is limited, but timing is important. Tricks can be linked together into combos.\n\nThe game has a minimalist look reminiscent of Canabalt. Messages in coloured boxes appear at the bottom screen for each trick or objective completed. Tracks have a limited distance and objectives need to be completed in the provided distance, but multiple objectives can be split over multiple sessions. There are five different environments (urban, junkyard, port, base, and neon city) with ten levels each. These are split up in five amateur and five pro levels, each with five objectives. Pro levels have more difficult objectives, for instance grabbing a certain item along the way. Later levels have more obstacles and hazards. Next to the career mode there is a spots mode. A spot is unlocked each time a level is completed. The spots mode is similar to the career mode, but requires a single, huge, uninterrupted combo to complete the challenge in a confined area. A third RAD Mode is initially locked. This mode offer challenges that can only be completed with perfect landings and grinds.\n\nThe game keeps track of the best times. There is a daily grind mode where players worldwide compete against each other on a new spot every day to get the highest score, but there is only one chance to compete per day. There are leaderboards (global and friends) and a tricktionary where all possible tricks are stored. The game also includes a tutorial.",

      "description": "<i>NBA Live 14</i> is the 2014 edition of the basketball series and the follow-up to NBA Live 10 as no new editions were released in the years between except for the mobile game NBA Elite 11.\n\nNew for this edition is BounceTek where the right stick is used for dribbling. Next to the Franchise mode there is a Rising Star mode where a custom player can be designed based on a number of presets. The amateur proves himself in a few games and is then drafted by a team and needs to complete various objectives to receive good grades and Rising Star points based on performance such as shots, passes and defensive actions. Online multiplayer is supported as well. In the Ultimate Team mode (a first for this series, already common for many other EA sports games) players manage a team. By competing online or in fantasy showdown challenges coins are earned to purchase players, uniforms and contracts.\n\nIn the Live Season mode regular updates introduce challenges based on scenarios of the current NBA season. These consist of BIG Moments (short challenges to relive performances for the team or individual players) and NBA Rewind (control the players based on their real performance in that game to recreate or surpass them). Player and team ratings as well as tendencies are also updated regularly. In the Dynasty mode players build a team and lead them through 25 seasons of NBA. This mode can be played with current rosters or by redoing the 2013 draft of rookie distribution. Each year the manager can choose to rebuild, compete or go for broke, with the overall goal to get the best team over multiple seasons.\n\nThe game contains a global experience system and social network system where all actions are rewarded with overall HoopsNet XP, tied to a player's profile. Gaining levels provides rewards. These levels are also used for the head-to-head seasons with four different tiers (Rookie, Pro, All-Star and Superstar) based on the level one to ten.",

Rather than fighting in a tournament, you fight matches in sets of three and must win at least two of them to progress. Moves are executed by holding the joystick in a direction and pushing the attack button. A grapple can be initiated by colliding with your opponent. During grapples, a meter appears on screen, and to execute a grapple move you have to tap the attack button rapidly then input a move when the meter reaches its highest point. To make things easier there's also a \"power up\" stock. By pushing the second button your character becomes more powerful for about a second or two, giving a big boost to the meter during a grapple.",

      "description": "<i>The Golf Club</i> is a simulation of the golf sports game. It is developed by HB Studios who are known for their work on various EA Sports titles, but this title is self-published and unlicensed (players, courses, equipment), except for the name and photograph of Greg Norman associated with the custom course designer portion.\n\nThe game can be played as a round, a tour or a tournament. It is not possible to create custom golfers, but the colours of the existing ones' outfit can be altered along with a left or right hand swing. The game is played from a third-person view. Unlike similar games, it does not use a timer or a bar to determine the shot's power or curve. Instead, the player chooses a club and shot type, and then has the power defined through the swing performed with a thumbstick or the mouse. While playing, the wind direction, elevation and distance to the pin are shown.\n\nNext to the courses included by default, it has an editor to design custom courses and share them globally. Players can browse the available courses through various filters and some courses get featured prominently. Even though no real life courses are licensed, many have been remade in the game by users. The setup of a new course is defined through a number of parameters such as length, terrain type and foliage density with sliders, and then it is automatically generated. The course can then be further altered by adding hazards, trees, water, animals and holes, editing the putting greens, or widening fairways. Existing courses by other users cannot be edited however. There are different themes for the courses, such as alpine, desert, rural, forest etc.\n\nThe game can be played offline with ghost opponents, up to four players locally (PC version), or online against friends. The multiplayer game modes include stroke play, match play, and fourball where all players' balls are shown on the course for each shot. Each play is saved online, so it is possible to compete with players' performances in the past with the option of friends rounds, record rounds or rivals rounds. The latter are rounds by players matched close to your own abilities. The ghost balls and scores can optionally be hidden. Other players around the world can also be followed live. The game keeps detailed statistics of each course and player, along with leaderboards.",

      "description": "The 2015 edition of the EA Sports FIFA football series is the second game for the then new generation of consoles. Unlike  FIFA 14, the PC version is now largely identical to the major console versions, using the new Ignite engine the first time for the platform, and the gap with the versions for previous generation consoles has become more extensive.\n\nExcept for some UI changes the offline career mode is largely identical. Searching for players still largely depends on scouting, but there are some new filters. The \u2018player search\u2019 function of the previous version does not return. Tiredness and injuries still have a major impact, but now it is possible to design and save multiple squads and swap them quickly, without going through every change manually each time. It is still possible to become a coach and helpful items can be bought in the FIFA Store. Next to the known offline game modes, the option returns to design a custom tournament.\n\nThe Ultimate Team mode still focuses on collecting players and assembling a team with Ultimate Team Online Seasons as a sub mode. Players are bought as card sets. The transfer market has been reworked to view all available cards for a single player at once and the prices can be compared quickly. The ability to add players on loan to your team is also a first and some are also available through the EA Football World Catalogue. The ability to play together with someone else returns to the Seasons mode, but players who prefer not to go against a team controlled by two players can disable this in the matchmaking. Matchmaking now also immediately searches a new opponent after a game is over.\n\nThe major changes to the gameplay itself focus on tighter through balls. Technical players are able to show their dribbling skills and team mates have an improved run strategy to anticipate the passes. The ball has been made more loose in players' handling, adding an element of randomness and more types of shots based on player ability, position and power. There\u2019s also a larger chance of defenders deflecting the ball\u2019s trajectory when in the line of a shot instead of just stopping it. The AI of keepers has been altered in accordance with the gameplay changes, adding in multiple calculation moments (when a ball changes trajectory for instance) and last minute saves.\n\nA final change is added focus on atmosphere to make the presentation resemble TV broadcoasts more closely. This edition also adds pitch deformation where the actions of players leave can wear the pitch down with marks. An entirely new feature is Matchday Live where all real life news headlines about the chosen club are brought together on a single page. The next real match is shown and it can be played right away.",

The game assists players new to the sport by showing overlaying diagrams on the court that tell you where to move and through a voiced coaching system. There are RPG elements to the progress and communication with the team is important through the mentor system. The subtitled conversations of the previous game have been replaced with recordings and these include the voices of real players of different teams. Off-field interactions provide a narrative to the career, including offers, agents and rivalries. There is an upgrading system to earn virtual currency through endorsements, performance badges and completing challenges.\n\nMyPark, called The Park in the previous edition, is the online streetball mode. You choose one of three cities and then play mostly two-on-two or three-on-three games against rival parks. You wait next to a field to assemble players and it is possible to join a crew to earn points that benefit everyone in the crew, while you receive a crew bonus. The moves of a player can be upgraded through dunk packages purchased through VC, the virtual currency. Large packs of this currency can be bought for real money. This mode uses the same player from the MyCareer mode, but here the focus is more on upgrading moves rather than spending the currency on performance boosts required for MyCareer. Real money can be spent on creating a distinct player through buying clothes. A fourth park called The Stage set on a rooftop is exclusive to the PS4 version of the game. It has the highest stakes for players to bet virtual currency on their matches. The PS4 version also comes with a 10,000 virtual currency bonus and a MyTeam card pack exclusive to PlayStation Plus members.\n\nThe MyGM mode returns where you manage an entire team. Unlike the previous edition this mode has been uncoupled from a required online connection, unlike most of the other game modes in this release. It is possible to play all games, but the focus is mostly on attracting new players, tracking their progress, determining tickets prices etc. There is also more focus on the conversations you have with the players as this has a distinct impact on their performance. MySeason is the game mode where you design a custom season with preferred teams. It also offers some European teams. MyTeam is the game mode similar to the Ultimate Team mode of the FIFA series where you collect card packs to assemble custom teams. You bet the cards in matches and by doing well you earn points to buy additional packs. You can also have your team compete against those of other players.\n\nDuring gameplay an optional timer appears as a semicircle below a player's feet when he is about to take a shot, providing assistance to get the timing right to improve accuracy, based on the timing, the player's statistics and fatigue, combined with distance and positioning relative to the defending team. The game contains many new animation, a redesigned defensive AI, and more control over blocks, steals and rebounding. New to this edition is scanning technology. Using the Kinect or PlayStation Eye peripheral you can have your face scanned to receive a realistic rendition in the game.",

The official statistics for the 2014-2015 season as well as the real players and jerseys are present. For the developer it is the first rugby game since Rugby World Cup 2011 and the title is a throwback to when they developed the rugby games for Electronic Arts, with Rugby 08 as the last title. For the sport in general it is the first licensed rugby game since the 2013 title Rugby Challenge 2.\n\nThe game offers individual matches or in any of the licensed competitions, with support for custom ones and specific rules. Up to four players can participate in a local match, but there is no support for online multiplayer. There is no career mode or team and player customization options. The game rules are taught through static information screens and in-game tips as there is no tutorial. Each individual player can be controlled during matches and there are multiple difficulty options. In-game commentary is provided by Stuart Barnes and Miles Harrison.\n\nRather than a simulation the game offers an arcade approach and players can perform moves such as sidesteps, hand-offs, pop passes, shoulder charges, grubber kicks, drop goals and tackles. More complex moves such as cross passes, up-and-unders and behind-the-back passes are also supported. Teams can be managed during or before and after matches with various statistics available. The team formation can also be changed quickly.",

It also has second division for English, Italy and Spain. Certain clubs such as the English ones and the Premier League are not licensed.

Buying players is done through in-game credits (GP) earned in the mode or other ones, also through achievements, but optionally microtransactions (myClub coins) can be used to invest real money. All players are however also accessible through regular means, but with a longer time to earn the required money. Earning GP raises the EXGP experience level and with a certain amount a new EXLV (level) is reaches. Games can be played against other human players or against the computer. Other game are Football Life, Match (quick games), Master League and Become a Legend. As with previous games it is possible to play 11-on-11 with 22 human players.",

      "description": "<i>Mat Mania</i> is a wrestling game and the spiritual successor to Tag-Team Wrestling. The player controls a wrestler in a televised event broadcast by the fictional T.W.A. (Taito Wrestling Association in the US version, Technos Wrestling Association in the Japanese version). The wrestler needs to compete against five opponents in a fixed order: Insane Warrior (US) / Insane Worrier (Japan), Karate Fighter, Coco Savage, The Pirania and Golden Hulk (US) / Blues Bloody (Japan). When the five fights are completed successfully a champion belt is presented in a ceremony and then the five fighters needed to be defeated again, but then drawn in a random order.\n\nThe fighter can be moved in eight directions and only two actions are used to kick and punch. Pressing both buttons simultaneously makes the character run. Based on the position in the ring it is possible to sprint and launch from the ropes, pin a wrestler, get on the ropes, throw a wrestler out of the ring, perform ring jump attacks, holds, grabs, a should block, a headlock, an Irish wisp, a body slam, a piledriver, a vertical suplex, a back body drop, an elbow smash, a clothesline, a jumping kick, a body splash, a sunset flip and a knee drop, and throw the opponent into the environment, also out of the ring.\n\nVarious celebrities and comic book characters make cameos as part of the spectator crowd. The game supports two players taking turns. For the Sharp X68000 platform the game is available only in the compilation Video Game Anthology Vol. 8: Exciting Hour / Shusse \u014czum\u014d.",

      "description": "<i>Rocket League</i> is the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It is a vehicle based, futuristic variant of football (soccer). Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with football the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to drive up the sides.\n\nCars have no means of attack and no health bar, but it is possible to ram other cars to hinder them. Vehicles also have the ability to jump and use nitro. Nitro boosts are limited, but can be refilled by driving over certain sections of the pitch. By winning matches experience is earned to level up and unlock new parts. The car can be fully customized in a garage with different types of bodies, colours, wheels, decals, nitro trails etc. which is new for this version. Next to one-time exhibition matches and online games, it has a full season mode. The player sets up a season and determines the length (number of weeks), difficulty (rookie, pro, all-star), play-offs and the team size, with multiple matches in succession. Matches generally last five minutes.\n\nThe game supports both offline (split-screen for up to four players) and online multiplayer. Matches can be played with two to up to eight players and online games support both ranked and unranked playlists. Multiplayer is platform independent. When playing alone team mates are controlled by the AI. The tutorial consists of several mini-games based on three categories: defence, offence, and aerial play. While playing a small arrow shows the location of the ball when it is in the air and the camera can be rotated around the car to keep track of the action. After scoring the ball is returned to the middle and the cars are flown back to their side of the pitch.",

      "description": "<i>Ride</i> is a motorcycle racing simulation that aims to recreate a realistic racing experience without any arcade elements. At the start the player designs a character and gets to choose between three bikes from the slowest category (under 700 CC). The main game modes are World Tour, Quick Mode (quick races and time trials) and Online. Most of the content is unlocked through the World Tour. By participating in different events, 'reputation' is earned to buy new bikes and accessories. Bikes can be fully customized based on the appearance, brakes and suspensions, engine, transmission and wheels. Every main category is further split up in different components. For the engine for instance the player can determine the air filter, cylinder head porting, electronic control unit, exhaust and oil type. Components and bikes come from licensed manufacturers, both historic and modern. The general statistics for bikes are acceleration, braking power, handling and top speed.\n\nThe world tour events consists of leagues such as naked bikes (middleweight and heavyweight groups), supersports, historic superbikes, modern superbikes, pro circuit, premium events (extremely limited bikes) and open races. Most of them only become available after acquiring the right type of bike. There are about 100 bikes in total, with displacements ranging from 250 to 1,299 cc and manufactured between 1987 and 2015. Each league is further split up in multiple groups of events. Racing events include single races, championships, drag races, endurance, head-to-head, time attack, track day (overtake a number of riders) on circuits inspired by real ones (GP tracks) and more general, open terrain races (city, country etc.). The Team Race game mode requires a team mate as the results of both riders combined determines the final standing. The team mate is a character that can be chosen, but is also possible to download the rider profile and appearance of a friend.\n\nThe game contains three simulation levels: Semi Pro, Standard and Pro. They influence the handling of the bike and sometimes lock guides at higher levels. Physics elements include auto brakes, joint brakes, an anti wheelie option, tuck-in, different settings for following the ideal trajectory (shown through coloured arrows on the track to show the best line and recommended speed), the type of transmission and influence over TCS (traction). The game also takes into account how the track evolves over multiple laps with rubbered in black marks that offer better grip. At lower levels it is possible to use multiple rewinds, allowing the player to rewind time after a mistake. Before each race the settings of the bike can be adjusted, based on the suspension (preload, spring stiffness, compression damping, rebound damping), handlebars and gears. While racing the player controls acceleration and braking (front and rear brake), shifting gears, steering, shifting weight, adjusting TCS and tuck-in. There are different camera options and it is possible to look to the sides or behind to keep an eye on the other racers.\n\nMultiplayer includes split-screen for two players, single races for up to twelve players and championships with multiple races in succession.",

      "description": "<i>WWE 2K15</i> is the 2015 installment in the long line of wrestling games developed by Yuke's and the second game under the <i>WWE 2K</i> banner following WWE 2K14. The fighters are based on the WWE license with a roster of 75 characters, smaller than the previous game. In general this edition tones down the arcade approach in favour of slower and more strategic gameplay. Strikes are for instance slower and the stamina system is more effective, especially noticeable for superstars that previously almost always stood up right away. There is a new type of stamina meter with three tiers, drained by enemy attacks. With each tier lost, the fighter becomes slower and more exhausted, eventually even unable to perform finishing moves.\n\nFrom the <i>Smackdown</i> titles in the series that ended in 2010 the game brings back a season mode in the form of MyCareer. Players get to design a custom wrestler in the game's Creative Suite and then build the wrestler's career, starting from the WWE Performance Center and NXT to the main WrestleMania event and finally the WWE Hall of Fame. It employs a storyline with decisions that lead to branching events and a morality system based on following or ignoring the rules. Matches are rated using a star system from one to five based on momentum, pacing and technique, and different ratings based on the type of match. The meter can be tweaked or turned off, for instance to drain slower or to regenerate.\n\nThe 2K Showcase mode lets players relive famous WWE feuds from the past 30 years such as Triple H vs Shawn Michaels and John Cena vs. CM Punk with specific objectives during the matches. It is similar to the Attitude Era mode from WWE '13. Multiplayer is supported in both offline and online matches. There are Steel Cage matches with an escape system, Hell in a Cell matches with weapons taken from under the ring. Two new match types, Three Stages of Hell and Casket Match are only available in the 2K Showcase Mode. Additional showcases are available as DLC.\n\nThere is a new type of submission system based on a circular gauge with two parts using only a single button, replacing the breaking point gauge from the previous game that required multiple buttons. Signature moves can be stored, and taunts and finishers are now combined into charged finishers. The game also brings back catapult and catch finishers. The fighting styles of wrestlers now resemble the style of the real wrestlers more, for instance through the usage and effect of power moves and high flyers. Certain wrestlers cannot climb to the top rope and perform moves from the second one.\n\nThe game is not entirely identical across the different platforms. The PS4 and Xbox One versions have additional and different features such as the MyCareer mode and a chain-wrestling mini-game. The latter is based on rock-paper-scissors type of match grapple based on three types of locks. It occurs only a few times per match and can optionally be disabled. Instead of MyCareer the PS3 and Xbox 360 version have the Who Got NXT mode as a story mode based on up-and-coming NXT Superstars. The second mode exclusive to those two platforms is Proving Ground, fighting against John Cena, similar to Defeat The Streak in the previous game. The game's Creative Suite no longer provides female wrestlers or eccentric designs, and also removes the ability to design stories and arenas, and use custom MP3 entrance soundtracks. Two elements, Create-An-Arena and Create-A-Championship, are only available in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. There are 25 Create-A-Superstar slots. It is possible to import custom logos and detailed editing for Superstar Heads. The older consoles do not use the face and body scanning technology for the platforms and rely on an updated engine and updated visuals from the previous version.",

      "description": "<i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5</i> is an entry in the <i>Tony Hawk</i> skateboarding series. Following various spin-offs it is once again a main game after Tony Hawk's Proving Ground in 2007. The game continues the classic gameplay of the original games and lets players create a custom skater or choose one of the ten professional ones: Aaron Homoki, Andrew Reynolds, Chris Cole, David Gonzalez, Ishod Wair, Leticia Bufoni, Lizzie Armanto, Nyjah Huston, Riley Hawk and Tony Hawk. Returning from Tony Hawk's American Wasteland there is a Create-A-Park mode where custom skate parks based on five themes can be created and shared online as new levels.\n\nIn the main career mode eight environments are visited (Asteroid Belt, Bonfire Beach, Mega Park, Mountain, Rooftops, School III, The Berrics and The Bunker) with about 80 missions. Next to regular environments, the Asteroid Belt is an exotic location with a skate park on an asteroid belt in space and a different form of gravity. Levels are not open world, but set in closed locations like the first games in the series. By completing objectives such as locating objects, performing certain tricks or collecting letters, stars are earned to unlock new levels. At least fifteen stars need to be earned in the previous level, as they are not cumulative, to unlock a new level. When all missions in a single stage are completed on the highest, 'Sick' rating for three stars, Pro Challenges are unlocked. The other ratings are 'Am' (one star) and 'Pro' (two stars), awarded based on the performance. Objectives include collecting the five SKATE letters, or the five COMBO letters in one interrupted combo of tricks. Collectibles include VHS tapes, destructible swag crates and DVDs. Next to these main objectives there are secondary ones such as clearing a series of rings in a quick time, keeping the tricks going to prevent the skater's head from exploding, collecting ice-cream, lighting torches with a burning skateboard or pushing beach balls out of a swimming pool.\n\nBy completing levels stat points are earned used to upgrade the skater for various categories multiple times: grind, lip trick, manual, ollie, speed, special, spin and vert. Completing challenges provides new aesthetic options to customize the skaters. Skaters string together tricks and combos with flips, manuals, ollies, grinds, grabs, plants, aerial moves and more. Through successive uninterrupted moves a meter is filled up and when full new special moves become available, replacing the default tricks. Entirely new is the slam technique allowing skaters to dive down immediately in mid-air. Multiplayer, only for PS4 and Xbox One, allows for 20 skaters in a single level, challenging each other. Free skating is always done online. Players then start offline missions, leaving the free skating mode, or join a lobby to challenge the other skaters. In a special mode more unrealistic tricks are available and more visual effects are added to the skater's moves.",

      "description": "<i>NBA 2K16</i> is the 17th main game in the annual NBA 2K series of basketball games. It is based on the 2015-2016 NBA season and features all of its competing teams as well as classic teams (including twelve new ones such as the 1999\u20132000 Toronto Raptors) and 25 European teams competing in the Euroleague. The basic gameplay works like in previous iterations but with some changes both in presentation and gameplay. This include upgraded player models and new animations, more realistic ball and rim physics and player collisions. Changes in controls include dedicated buttons for lobs and bounce passes. In addition to playing individual exhibition matches there are numerous other game modes such as MyCareer, MyGM, MyLeague and MyTeam.\n\nThe MyCareer mode is called Livin' Da Dream and was developed in association with film maker Spike Lee. It is designed to be more story oriented and cinematic than previous games' career modes and sees the player taking control of a young basketball player from Harlem called Frequency Vibrations (\"Freq\"). Freq starts out in a small high school team but as the story progresses he will move first to a college team and later the NBA. The ultimate goal is to become one of the greatest players of all time. Before starting out it is possible to customize the appearance of the player and to choose a position and scoring style. Games in the career modes only involve controlling one player with the others being AI driven. Between games the player has access to his own customizable court where he can upgrade his character or practice playing the game. It's also possible to invite online friends to private games. In addition to playing the games the career mode also involves making choices off the court while interacting with other players, coaches, media and fans. \n\nThe MyGM mode allows the player to become the general manager of a team. This means the player has access to all aspects of the game including signing and trading players, negotiating contracts with both players and coaches, interacting with the team owner as well as media, building facilities and many other managerial tasks. New to this edition is the ability to move the team to a new city, summer leagues, three team trades and the ability to customize arenas and jerseys. The MyLeague mode is similar to MyGM but removes certain restrictions to make the game more flexible with more customization options. Whereas MyGM is an offline mode, MyLeague features various online components. The MyTeam mode involves building a team by collecting trading cards. By collecting cards players, playbooks and other items can be unlocked. Cards are bought with virtual currency and come in packs with a random selection of items. They have different levels indicating how good they are with bronze cards being cheaper, while gold cards are of higher quality. ",

      "description": "<i>Baseball Riot</i> is not really a game that focuses on actual baseball or its rules, but instead takes the batting part from it and turns it into a puzzle game with various obstacles, tricks, and things to hit on a single screen. You control a batter on the screen and have as many balls to strike as you can before the time runs out or you manage to hit everything required of you. The ball will bounce off walls and other obstacles and will disappear after a certain number of hits or traveling length. Up to two balls can be active at the same time which lets you shoot them in succession, but in order to launch the third ball, the first one first has to disappear. Obstacles vary from solid to breakable, and there are various objects which can be hit, such as opposing players or golden stars which increase your clearing score for the level. The game features a large grid map where you progress one square at the time, and cleared levels can be replayed to try and earn a higher score.",

      "description": "<i>FIFA 16</i> is the third game for the then new generation of consoles in the EA Sports FIFA football series with feature parity for the PC version, just like the year before. The most typical update is the actualized content for stadiums, teams (both national leagues and national teams), and players statistics. A first for the series, women's teams are included with twelve national teams. Those matches can be played in different game modes: offline and online friendly games, and a tournament mode based on the FIFA Women's World Cup. Mixed matches are not possible.\n\nThe main Career mode is updated with a new training mode. It is used to develop players and this is done through skill game, similar to how it was introduced in 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. This is encouraged to raise a player's transfer value. Prior to a new season it is possible to play a European tournament to earn additional starting money. The familiar Ultimate Team mode is also updated, focused on building a team through different decks of cards further supported through optional microtransactions for real money. There are some changes to the interface and the filtering systems for the transfer market. The versions for the different platforms are largely identical. A number of Legends (legendary players) for this game mode are exclusive to the Xbox versions, with players such as Deco, Litmanen and Giggs. FUT Draft is a new element for this mode, as a simplified version of the main game mode, but based on a selection of five players, and where Team Chemistry is equally important.\n\nFor the gameplay there are changes to the defensive mechanisms, most apparent through the better positioning of the defenders to keep the open spaces as small as possible. This can be countered on the offensive side with a 'pass with purpose', a hard pass that can split the defense in many occasions, but is hard to control for strikers. There are new options for dribbling, for instance through faking a pose in a certain direction using the body to lure a defender in a certain direction.",

The Vision AI system allows the AI players to react to both current and projected plays on the ice. The crowd now has 9,000 different models and four times the animations than in previous titles.\n\nThe game features the \"NHL on NBC\" system, which includes infographics across all modes in an attempt to add to the realism of presentation.

      "description": "<i>Football Frenzy</i> is an American Football game. It allows players to pick from a selection of ten fictional teams to play in an eight-team single elimination tournament (for one player) or in a head-to-head game (for two players).\n\nThe action is seen from a top-down view of the field but with the players seen from an angled view. Before a play, the offensive player can select from eight running plays, eight passing plays and two kick plays (field goal and punt), whereas the defensive player cannot chose plays. The play selection changes over the course of the tournament, or depending on the position on the field in a two-player game. On running plays, the camera zooms in on a closer view of the field.\n\nControls involve a joystick and four buttons. The A button is the primary action button, used to hike the ball and to make the current player run faster by tapping repeatedly. On passing plays, buttons B, C and D are used to choose the receiver. On defense, the B button switches to the defender closest to the ball.",

      "description": "<i>Moto Racer 4</i> is a title in the long-running arcade motorcycle racing series that was started in 1997. It keeps the core element of letting players race with heavy bikes on asphalt tracks, along with slower but more technically challenging dirt bike off-road races, but it also introduces a lot of new elements. Multiplayer is supported against another player locally through split-screen and online with up to ten players for multiple game modes. Quick races consist of a championship, hot lap, a single race, and time attack.\n\nProgressing through the game to unlock everything is done in the career mode. It has events such as Catch-up, Ghost Bike, Golden Helmet, King of the Road, Last Man Riding, Single Race, and Wolf Pack. In Catch-up opponents get a head start and the player needs to catch up and overtake them to reach the first place with a limited amount of time. Ghost Bike also starts at the back of a pack, but here the player has to reach a specific position without going off the track or bumping into other racers. In Golden Helmet the first racer to reach a checkpoint receives a golden helmet and needs to hold on to it as long as possible. It is taken away when crashing or being hit by other racers. In King of the Road all players start with the same amount of time on a clock. When in first place the clock counts down, but other players receive a speed boost. Then the first player to lose all time wins the event. Last Man Riding is a race where the last racer is eliminated after a certain amount of time until there is only one left. Wolf Pack is a chase event where one racer gets a head start. All other racers are behind, need to catch up and hold the lead.\n\nIn each event up to three stars can be earned based on the performance. Stars are needed to keep progressing and unlocking new events. There are ten riders to choose from, each with two types of bikes (street and dirt) with different statistics for acceleration, handling, max speed and the T.U.R.B.O boost module. Upgrade points can be earned to improve the statistics and there are different colour schemes for customization. Those points are earned by showing off and reaching a style objective in events. Style points are earned through moves such as tricks in the air (in dirt bike races), drifting, high speed, staying in a slipstream, brushing other riders or traffic and so on. There are also penalties for crashing or going off the track. Typically for the series wheelies can also be done, not only for style points but also for a speed boost with a cooldown period. It is a risky manoeuvre as it briefly makes the handling harder. Boosts are also earned by doing perfect landings on two wheels. Later on more advanced tricks can be unlocked such as a boost landing, return on the track, slipstream, start, and wheelie. It is possible to use a horn, provoke other riders, swerve to knock them off their bikes, and skid around corners by braking. Environments range from a sunny Bay Area to Asia and many of them have multiple routes and shortcuts.",

      "description": "<i>Steep</i> is an open world winter sports game based around four extreme sports: paragliding, skiing, snowboarding and wingsuit flying. The game was launched with a mountain in the Alps to explore, but another set in Alaska was added for free at a later time. The player is free to explore and can walk around. At any moment it is possible to switch to one of the four sports and continue that way. There is no linear path to follow, but by unlocking base camps, spotting drop zones and accessing new challenges by leveling up, steady progress along an increased difficulty level is possible. At any moment the player can enter a top-down mountain view to quickly move between spots or challenges. Previous trails can be revisited, there are replays and it is possible to design and share challenges for other players. Players can also appear in each other's worlds to be invited to fly, ride of ski together.\n\nEach sport has different controls and possibilities. It is possible to perform a large amount of stunts, mainly while skiing and snowboarding. Different types of challenges focus on fast times, large points through tricks or exploration. During wingsuit flying the focus is on avoiding obstacles and staying close to the ground to score points. Paragliding is more about navigating the best course to reach checkpoints. Most of them are specific for a sport, such as Big Air, Forest Slaloms or Proximity Flying. While a character cannot die there is a health system based on sustained g-forces and recovering after a fall takes some time.\n\nIn most challenges up to three medals can be earned and they can retried infinitely. Next to overall player progress and new spots unlocked that way, a large amount of gear is made available gradually to customize the different characters. Overall progress is done in six categories based on the playing style: Bone Collector, Explorer, Extreme Rider, Freerider, Freestyler, and Pro Rider. Next to the challenges, drop zones and points of interest, the player can also experience mountain stories and events called memorable moments.",
