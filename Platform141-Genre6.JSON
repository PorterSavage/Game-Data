      "description": "<i>Twisted Metal: Black</i> is the fifth game in the car-combat series. Only on the PlayStation 2, the game includes old favorites and a lot of new characters. The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up. Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  The game also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together. The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, <i>Paint It Black</i>.",

      "description": "After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime.  During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime.  Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude.  Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process.  Now it is time for revenge.  Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others.  Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way.  It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i> is similar in its concept to its predecessors: the player is cast in the role of a vicious (albeit novice) criminal, who performs tasks for crime lords and gradually raises his rank in the criminal world. Driving is the main gameplay element in the game, though the player can also fully explore the city on foot. For the first time in the series, the entire game is rendered in 3D. Different camera angles are available for driving, and free camera rotation is available when on foot. \n\nAs opposed to the previous games, Liberty City is the only city the player can explore in the game. The game puts more emphasis on the story, displaying cutscenes before each mission. In order to complete the game it is necessary to perform all the main story missions; however, the player often has the choice between several missions at a given moment. The missions include chases, races, short third-person shooter sequences, as well as various mini-game-like activities. Outside of the missions, the player is free to explore the city and undertake sub-missions, for example working as a taxi driver, delivering sick people to the hospital in an ambulance car, etc. ",

Here's what LucasArts says about it:\r\n\r\nIt has been eight years since the first spectacular Podracing showdown between Sebulba and the young Anakin Skywalker. Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot. Thus the stage is set for Star Wars\u00ae Racer Revenge\u2019, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good. \r\nGet down and dirty against 16+ of the most aggressive Podracers in the galaxy and smash your opponents into twisted wreckage\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel the heat and roar of a horde of opponents on your tail--the turbo-charged Podracer AI means you're never on the track alone\r\n\r\n\r\nNew, never-before-seen characters and Podracers, plus a few of your old favorites\r\n\r\n\r\nRace to the finish in the Boonta Eve Classic or earn your place in the winner's circle on 13 devilishly challenging courses on four new planets, plus Tatooine\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple game modes include practice, single play, tournament, time trials and versus\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Rainbow Studios, makers of the hit games Motocross Madness and ATV Off-Road Fury \r\n",

      "description": "Tommy Vercetti is a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends.  Because he didn't rat out his \"family\", Tommy's sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything.  Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it's up to Tommy to clear a path.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> offers the same free-roaming driving and action gameplay style as its predecessor, but in a new setting based on the city of Miami. The game includes all the features of the previous installment and builds upon them. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of typical vehicles from the 1980's. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from <i>GTA III</i>. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat.\n\nNew to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFirearms are for the most part the same as in <i>GTA III</i>, and melee weapons have been added to the protagonist's arsenal. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Activities outside of the missions (driving taxis, delivering sick people to hospitals, firefighting and playing a vigilante policeman) are available as well.\n\nTo effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured in the previous game) across ten radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as <i>I Ran</i> by Flock of Seagulls, <i>The Message</i> by Grandmaster Flash, <i>You've Got Another Thing Coming</i> by Judas Priest, and <i>Out of Touch</i> by Hall & Oates.",

For two years Jak is experimented on with dark Eco, turning him into an almost Hulk-like character, mean and filled with rage. \n\nRescued by Daxter, the two must set off and find a way to shut down the operation and get revenge for Jak's uncontrollable change. Along the way they will meet new friends and deadly enemies (known as Metal Heads), but at least now Jak has something special on his side: weapons, and lots of them. Including a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon. Gameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights).",

      "description": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.\n\nThe missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.\n\nAs in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

      "description": "<i>Thrash Rally</i> is a fast-paced racing game, similar to Neo Drift Out and Overtop, but using a top-down view. You can either participate in a World Championship or do a complete Paris Dakar rally.<br /><br />\r\nUsing basic controls: accelerate with automatic transmission, brake and a combination of both to power drift, you have to follow a set path of courses. In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.\r\n\r\nA global ranking is kept while racing, but it is based on your time, not on the number of cars you pass during the race. Aside from your opponents, you'll also find water, animals, hills, bridges, bushes and different obstacles in your path.",

Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.",

      "description": "<i>Retro City Rampage</i> is an open-world game inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series that combines driving with fighting and shooting in a retro 8-bit style. Originally started as a homebrew NES demake of Grand Theft Auto III, it was eventually developed into a full game. The game is set in eighties and the protagonist is a mullet-styled gangster who wreaks havoc in Theftropolis city. It draws many elements from the series it was inspired by, such as the ability to hijack any car, fight on foot with melee and ranged weapons, and shake off the law when too many crimes are committed.\n\nThe main story mode consists of a number of missions that involve heists, extortion, but for instance also helping out Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movies to help repair his time travel car. The game has a quirky style and hectic pace, and is filled to the brim references to popular culture, especially movies, celebrities and other games with many cameo appearances. Next to the main mission various side missions can be taken on or the city can be explored in full at the player's leisure. During certain parts 30 challenges can be triggered where an objective needs to be completed in a short time, such as driving around a tank or getting air time shooting a bazooka. These can later be replayed as arcade challenges from the main menu. In addition there is a free roaming mode with the maximum amount of money right from the start.\n\nThe protagonist, dubbed The Player, can fight with his fists and other melee weapons, or shoot a large variety of guns. There are about 25 in total. These are collected while playing or are bought in shops. There is also a cover system where it is possible to duck behind objects and fire quickly. Any car or bike of the 40 available can be taken over and pedestrians can be mowed down, leaving behind money. The gun targeting has a lock system where it is possible to strafe around an opponent without losing the target direction. Other options include the ability to jump, and pick up and throw objects, including pedestrians. Committing too many crimes raises a threat meter causing the police force to arrive in increasingly larger numbers. The main character can buy various customizations, play arcade games or gamble at the casino. There are five special, permanent power-ups such as \"Speed 'Kills' Shoes\" for faster speed that are discovered or bought throughout the game. Vehicles can be repainted at spray garages, but cops can also be shaken off by collecting cop cloaking devices that make them lose the trail. Health is replenished by collecting hearts or buying food at vending machines.\n\nIn November 2014 <i>Retro City Rampage: DX</i> was launched, a new version for all previous platforms and introducing new platforms. It is a re-mastered version with the ability to switch to the original version of the game in the options. It was originally launched as the initial version for the 3DS platform earlier that year. Changes include faster vehicles, more checkpoints, tutorials, hint screens and tweaked missions, challenges, visual effects, visual enhancements and difficulty. Weapons can be selected from a grid instead of cycling through them and there is a new UI for the handheld version, including zoom, touch and a dynamic camera. There are more video filters options and two additional graphics modes: RETRO+ and 8-BIT. Weapons have been rebalanced and it is now possible to jump right away after shooting. The update also introduces parking garages where 54 cars can be parked.",

      "description": "<i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> takes place five years after Grand Theft Auto IV and is now set in Los Santos. It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.\n\nMichael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael's son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin's help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael's old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.\n\nThe game's multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story. It allows up to 16 players (PS3 / Xbox 360) or 30 players (Xbox One / PS4 / PC) to travel around a world identical to the single-player world to complete story-driven activities, both competitive and co-operative.\n\nThe later released PS4, Xbox One and PC versions have various enhancements and additional features. Technical upgrades include an increased draw distance and support for higher resolutions. New content includes new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects.

Like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit it supports two storylines: The Racer and The Cop (with three separate paths: patrol, enforcer, or undercover). Both have a full career progression, through speedlists for the racer and assignments for the cop. Players level up by completing objectives. There are gadgets such as an EMPs, shockwaves and the ability to call in roadblocks that can be upgraded. The game takes place in the fictional location Redview County. It is an open world with 160 km (100 miles) of streets.\n\nThe game still incorporates the Autolog system and introduces AllDrive, which allows the player to seamlessly transition from the single-player game to online multiplayer, both cooperatively and head-to-head.",

      "description": "<i>Race the Sun</i> is an endless racer set in an abstract environment. The player controls a solar craft hovering above the surface and it needs to survive as long as possible, racing after the sun that provides the power to move on. The game world is procedurally generated and changes each day. It is divided into regions with a completely different lay-out each day, but with fixed mutators for each region to build a similar difficulty curve for every session.\n\nTo survive the craft needs to dodge moving and falling blocks, pillars, shapes and projectiles that appear in quick succession. Acceleration is done automatically and it cannot be slowed down. The craft can be steered left and right endlessly, as there is no border to the game world. The quickest way to gain speed is by picking up yellow boost items, slightly reversing the sun path for a while. Green items provide a jump that can be triggered at any moment, allowing the craft to fly. Purple ones provide a second chance after a crash. Obstacles are not the only concern, as tunnels, clouds or objects blacking out the sun also need to be avoided as they deplete the available energy. The game is over when there is no more sunlight or after a crash. Along the way blue tris can be collected, triangles that add up to a score multiplier. When bumping into an obstacle, not causing a complete collision, some speed is lost and the multiplier is reset. The gameplay is fast-paced and requires good reflexes in the later regions. By steering in a certain direction and quickly switching, a barrel roll can be performed.\n\nThe game offers different objectives that can be completed over multiple sessions, such as achieving a certain amount of air time, clearing a region without a single collision, collecting a number of tris, achieving a certain score etc. This allows the craft to level up with a cap at 25. With almost every level some new options become available, such as decals for the ship or attachments. The latter include a magnet that collects nearby pick-ups automatically, a battery to survive longer without energy, storage for multiple jump pick-ups or shields etc. These have an upgraded version as well. It is possible to fit multiple attachments at a certain level and another type of bonus provides a higher multiplier level at the start.\n\nAfter a while a secondary Apocalypse mode is unlocked, set in a different world with a higher difficulty level and meteorites that cause temporary blindness. The game's editor support the creation and sharing of user made levels through the Steam workshop. These can be downloaded and played separately and some are also accessed in the game's main mode through world portals in the game world, temporarily moving the game into a very different environment before continuing. There are global leaderboards to compare scores.\n\nIn February 2015 the unlockable Labyrinthia mode was added. It is an advanced, randomized maze filled with obstacles, switches and moving parts. It largely takes the sun and reflex based movement out of the equation in favour of planning ahead. It uses a more zoomed out view.",

      "description": "<i>Driveclub</i> is a road racing game combining both offline and online races, but with a global experience level for both. The game's focus is on forming an online racing club with up to six racers in total. Each club member can race with a different car, but they can share emblems and decorations to distinguish themselves as a club. The score system ties the single-player performances to the online ones, where an entire club can benefit from a single player's successes, also unlocking new vehicles and events with cars on loan for players not yet at the required level, even when not doing club races. As a club, players can sign up for an event and then race another group. It is not possible to design a custom event, these are provided by the developers. While racing players earn points for different actions such as drafting and gaining positions, but these can also be deducted for cutting corners, ramming into other vehicles or slamming into obstacles. For certain collisions the player is punished with a penalty of three seconds with limited speed. At the end of the race it does not matter which player reaches first place, it is the total team score that determines which club wins. The performance of other players in a club can be tracked through a social hub.\n\nThe gameplay mixes arcade elements with simulation, as players are rewarded for being patient, learning corners and takeover opportunities, and following the ideal racing line. However, bumping into other cars and cutting them off is also possible. Next to the offline single races against AI-controlled cars there is a single-player tour. It is a campaign with about fifty events divided over five levels unlocked gradually by completing challenges and earning stars by reaching a top place, doing a cornering challenge, maintaining a certain average speed or beating a certain time. There are 225 stars in total to earn and with set amounts new events are opened up. Next to star points, fame points can be earned for the global experience level, also affecting the club. Even when doing single-player there is a social link, as you can see challenges by other players and create your own after doing well in a race as a type of asynchronous multiplayer. It is possible to browse all existing challenges and by beating them both you and your club earn points.\n\nThe cars are licensed and divided into five classes: Hot Hatches, Sports, Performance, Super and Hyper. Cars are unlocked gradually by reaching a new driver level. They are based on four main statistics: acceleration, top speed, handling and drifting, but tuning is not possible except for determining the colour, coating and manual or automatic transmission. The tracks are inspired by locations around the world and generally there are three types of events: time trials, regular track races and drifting challenges.",

Improvements over the last game include more detailed graphics and futuristic, high-tech backgrounds as completely new environment.\n\nThe goal of the game is to race on fantastical tracks with ramps and unrealistically high jumps and reach the finish with as few crashes as possible. The game has a 2.5D environment, in that it is fully 3D modeled but players can only move on a single lane. Career is the main game mode with skill challenges for each tier as an extra challenge next to the regular tracks. Entirely new are level-specific challenges that can be completed for each track, for instance by restricting or forcing a certain riding style.\n\nThe player can hit gas and break to move, and lean forward or backward to balance the bike. During long jumps player can perform mid-air stunts like back flips for bonus points. New to the series is the ability to perform free stunts in the air and the addition of quad bikes next to the regular motorcycles. In multiplayer mode, both offline and online, up to four players ride in individual lanes. When a player crashes or goes off screen they respawn in a position close to remaining players. The game contains a track editor to create custom courses in the Create mode, but unlike the previous game <i>Trials Evolution</i> it is no longer possible to create supercross courses. Tracks can be shared and downloaded through the in-game Track Central.",

      "description": "<i>The Crew</i> is a racing game set in an open world environment of a scaled-down version of the United States. Players have the ability to drive from coast to coast with the inclusion of major cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and New York, as well as specific locales such as Pikes Peak, the Laguna Seca race track, famous landmarks such as Cape Canaveral, many highways and smaller towns. In the single-player campaign the player controls Alex Taylor. He is a witness to the murder on his brother Datton, the leader of a crew called the 5-10's, but is arrested himself. Five years later he is given the opportunity by the FBI to hunt down his brother's killer Dennis 'Shiv' Jefferson, the gang's leader, as he is deployed to unmask the corrupt FBI agent Coburn who is also involved. He has to join the crew himself and make a name for himself to rise up the ranks.\n\nThe missions consist of a large amount of races and cut-scenes further the story, but there are also smaller challenges called 'skills' such as slalom courses, staying on the ideal racing line, making big jumps to cross gaps and maintaining a certain speed for a set distance. Skills are triggered by driving through them. Next to regular checkpoints races against the clock or opponents there are specific tasks such as stealing a certain car, transporting packages, escaping from cops, performing takedowns or chauffeuring. As Taylor rises up the ranks and get tasks from the crew's tiers V, V2, V4, V6 and eventually V8, new areas open up. The entire world is available right away, but the missions in the areas to the west only open up when a certain level has been reached and events usually recommend a car of a certain level.\n\nCars do not need to follow roads and can generally race on any type of terrain. There are specs for each type of environment that enhance performance, such as Circuit, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Street, but not all cars have access to all of them. The game world uses a day-and-night cycle and a large map can be used to plan a route with navigation. Taylor gains experience to level up and the same applies to the cars. Regularly new car parts are supplied, often based on his performance, to upgrade the car. With each new level perks become available, used to give Taylor an experience boost or to further enhance the cars.\n\nNext to the solo parts players can join crews to share the experience, work together and progress quicker. Crews of up to four people can form temporarily alliances with online players or with friends. Up to eight players are supported simultaneously in a single session. After the initial of the parts factions become available, such as the Eagles on the East Coast and the Wolves in the Midwest. Players get to join a certain faction to access PvP and PvE races. Joining a crew is the only way to earn crew credits, a secondary currency to buy perks and cars. The game supports microtransactions with real money to buy cars, but you cannot acquire any above your current level. This is never required to progress in the game. Crew credits can also be bought as large credits packs.\n\nEach crew has a crew leader who can take a number of decisions, such as restarting a mission. There is also a large amount of social features to track scores and compare with friends. The game contains many types of cars from licensed manufacturers such as Aston Martin, Bentley, BMW and Ferrari. After the main game has been completed and level 50 is hit, platinum car parts can be obtained, as opposed to the gold ones, encouraging players to continue racing as these provide a random statistics boost to get the best possible car for PvP matches at the highest level.",

      "description": "<i>Assetto Corsa</i> is a driving simulator. Its stress is on physics models and vehicles' dynamic behaviour (a proprietary physics engine is employed) and general realism; for example, the tyre rubber deposited on track\n(depending on the laps and amount of in-race cars) and the sun position (depending by geographical coordinates\nof the track and by the sun curve according to time and date) in order to get the same light conditions of the real tracks, are calculated in real time.\n\nGame modes are:<ul><li>solo mode: career, practice, special events (drag races, drift challenges, other challenges</li> <br>\n<li>solo and multiplayer: quick race (totally both in solo and online multiplayer mode) , race weekend (free practice, qualifying session and race), multiplayer</li></ul>Solo and multiplayer races are editable. Driver assistance is offered in 4 settings, resulting in 4 levels of difficulty: gamer, racer, pro, totally customisable (ranging from wholly simulative setting to assistance allowing play with the joystick, from real-world car damage \u2014 both aesthetical and functional \u2014 to disabling it completely).\n\nThe game plays from a first-person view, or from inside the cockpit, on the hood, or exterior. Supported control peripherals include steering wheels, professional simulative devices and the most common motion systems, as well as keyboard, joystick, gamepad. Also featured are triple monitor view, track IR, 3D VISION, and the Oculus Rift. Additional features are car customization, car setup, time of the day selection, telemetry and real-time\ncontrol of movable aerodynamics parts by telemetry input channels, replay and photo mode features, live track, as well as an \u201capp\u201d system (in-game overlay). The number of online racers is determined by the amount of pit-boxes available on the given race circuit. Editing tools, the same as those used by the development team, are available for vehicle and circuit modding.

      "description": "<i>Super Toy Cars</i> is an arcade racing game and the follow-up to Toy Cars. Just like the original it is based on the concept of Micro Machines where very small cars are driven through everyday environments. The game can be played with a classic top-down view or two third-person perspectives. There is a general career mode, a quick race mode and multiplayer, offline for up four and online for up to eight players.\n\nThe career mode consists of eight racing classes unlocked gradually and six events for each. By completing races credits are earned and points. The latter are used to unlock new races. Race modes include classic multi-lap track racing against opponents, time trial, elimination, evade (elimination with mines on the track) and time-based checkpoint races. There are twelve different tracks based on four locations. Credits are used to unlock new cars and buy upgrades. Cars have different statistics based on acceleration, maximum speed, handling, weight, drift and boost. There are different paint jobs and cars can be upgraded one time for the following parts: boost, engine, turbo, tyres, gearbox, weight reduction and brakes. There are sixteen cars in total.\n\nRaces often have shortcuts and various obstacles. There are also seven power-ups to collect: oil spill, glue spill, mine, spring trap, boost filling, 8 ball (a giant billiard ball is launched) and missile. By drifting and jumping a boost bar is filled. When full it can be activated to gain extra speed. Drifting is done through a separate key or button. There are two drifting modes that can be defined in the options, one where the key needs to be held down and another where you press it once to start drifting and once more to stop.\n\nThe game includes a track editor and through Steam Workshop integration custom tracks can be shared with other players. Races have a a replay mode and there is a short, interactive tutorial where the mechanics are introduced.",

As the camera stays fixed relative to the car, the controls need to be adjusted based on the position on the track. The game is set on three planets with sixteen tracks in total. During races there is no health; when knocked off the track the car automatically respawns. All racers are kept in view at all times. When one car lags behind it eventually respawns closer to the other racers.\n\nIn the career mode races need to be completed based on different game modes. There are regular circuit races, time trials, death races and king races. In death races races the cars are chased by a giant spiked steamroller. Every now and then it approaches, destroying all cars in the way until only one remains. Points are then awarded based on the position and there are multiple sessions until a survivor race is completed. When knocked off the track in a survivor race, the car does not respawn until the next session. King races are won by staying in the lead longer than the other racers, regardless of the ending position. By winning races points, cups and medals are earned. Cups are objectives specific for each track. By doing well additional tracks and racers are unlocked. Each racer has different statistics based on mass, acceleration and handleability. Slow cars have little acceleration, but are not affected much by projectiles. Fast cars have great acceleration, but are easily knocked off the track. There are also racers that slightly hover above the track.\n\nWhile racing various pick-ups spawn. There is a boost that can be activated by the player, either as a regular boost or different types of strong ones that can also easily catapult a car into the void. Weapon pick-ups include an autogun, a seeking missile, a chainsaw blade, a slime shot that slows down and a soundwave. As opponents cannot be destroyed permanently (except for survivor races), the main goal is to use weapons to knock opponents off the tracks and gain the lead. There is also a focus on drifting through corner and avoiding obstacles and the track borders. The game supports multiplayer for up to four players offline and eight players online.",

      "description": "Kinzie has birthday and the whole Saints Row crew celebrates! Matt brought a Ouija board, but unfortunately it calls Satan and drags the Boss into Hell. Gat and Kinzie follow them to rescue their leader. There they'll meet old acquaintances (e.g. Dane Vogel and Dex) and historical figures (e.g. Shakespeare and Blackbeard).\n\n<i>Saints Row: Gat out of Hell</i> is an add-on sized successor to Saints Row IV. The main difference to the main game is the lack of story missions - the plot progresses by doing enough side missions. When enough chaos is created, a cutscene starts and a new side mission type gets unlocked. After the third cutscene, the player is ready to face the end boss. Other major differences are the city (Hell is new, but smaller in scope than Steelport), the lack of customization (the player either controls Gat or Kinzie) and no licensed music.\n\nCharacter development is identical to <i>Saints Row IV</i> except that new super powers are unlocked by finding and activating altars and flying works a bit different: Kinzie/Gat don't hover like Superman, but have giant wings. This causes them to slow down over time until they flap. They start with one flap per flight, but this number can be upgraded. While most distractions are known from the predecessor (but re-designed to fit the scenario), a few of them are new, e.g. shutting down factories by fighting over three control points. The four available activities are hellblazing (a flying checkpoint race), torment fraud (a insurance fraud variant), mayhem (causing chaos with a given weapon/vehicle) and salvation (husks fall from the sky and have to be collected by the flying player before they reach the ground).",

      "description": "<i>Project CARS</i> is a racing simulation similar to the Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports and GTR FIA Racing series. Different to those titles the game does not offer initial content where the player has to race and earn experience to perform upgrades and additional cars and tracks. Instead, all of the content is available right away and players can race in any mode, class, car and on any circuit immediately. Similar to games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa it offers very detailed customization where players can fine-tune almost any aspect of the cars, but contrary to those two titles there is not only multiplayer racing, but also a full career mode with offline races against AI-controlled opponents. Optionally various assists can be enabled to simply the gameplay.\n\nThe game offers circa 70 cars in various types of motorsports such as classic retro tour cars, traditional road cars, karts, track day cars, supercars, modern open wheel cars, GT cars and Le Mans prototypes. Brands include Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Ford, Lotus, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Renault and more. Brands such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are not included. Certain cars are part of a modified car pack, some are tied to a specific edition and others are given away for free each month. The game includes a large amount of racing circuits from around the world as well as a number of fictional ones and also point-to-point races.\n\nThe career mode offers several goals to climb the ranks, win championships and earn contracts to race in higher series. Examples of challenges include <i>Defending Champ</i> to win three seasons in a row undefeated, <i>Triple Crown</i> to win three different types of championships and <i>Zero to Hero</i> where you go through championships for the different race classes, from karts to Formula 1. There are several championships presented as race weekends split up in practice rounds, qualifiers and race sessions that often consist of multiple races. Optionally certain sessions can be skipped or simulated. It is possible to design custom races, there are various weather conditions and the developers organize events regularly. Online multiplayer is not done through matchmaking but through playlists curated by the developer. Next to regular races it is possible to challenge other players to time trials. The Driver Network keeps track of the player's progress, stats and results for the various cars and parts of the game. \n\n<i>CARS</i> from the title is an acronym for <i>Community Assisted Racing Simulator</i>, which reflects the game's development. The game was crowd funded where contributors could involve themselves in the development through Tool Packs which allowed for the creation of assets, content, QA and other parts of the development process with various rewards.",

      "description": "<i>Roundabout</i> is a racing game played from an almost top-down view and set in an open world environment. The protagonist is the female limousine driver Georgio Manos. She gets to pick up passengers to perform missions, but there is a catch. Inspired by the mechanics of the GBA game Kuru Kuru Kururin, the limousine constantly revolves with a constant speed. The car can be steered in any direction, but the spinning limousine can only take a few hits before it explodes. The game was also inspired by elements of the Crazy Taxi and Grand Theft Auto series. The environment can be explored freely, but several areas, usually connected through bridges, only become accessible after completing a number of missions. To navigate the environment the spinning movement needs to be used strategically to pass narrow sections, but it can just as well be used to kill pedestrians.\n\nThe game is set in 1977 and uses a '70s b-movie style. Whenever a customer enters the limousine the mission is introduced through a live-action cut-scene with a cast that consists almost entirely of developers of large and indie game studios. Missions usually require Georgio to reach a destination on another part of the map, but each mission consists of multiple optional objectives and they can be replayed to complete all of them. Examples of optional objectives are not having the car explode, a time limit, collecting a number of items etc. Various actions and missions are rewarded with cash, also by building up combos by not hitting anything and collecting tokens, stringing together actions quickly in succession before the window of opportunity is gone.\n\nNext to the main missions there is a large number of challenges such as bouncing a ball on top of the car, avoiding falling cars, a destruction derby etc. Once unlocked these can be replayed right away from the main menu as well. Cash is used to buy hats for the limousine as well as various paint jobs. Optionally cash stashes can be located in the environment and a large amount of horn types are hidden. The car can be repaired and customized at special buildings that can be tracked through a mini-map. Gradually various power-ups for the car are unlocked and only one can be equipped at all times. These include the ability to slow down time, reversing the spinning direction, traveling over water, shooting traffic cones etc. The limousine is able to boost and soon learns to jump as well. From then on it is possible to jump on top of buildings and roundabouts to avoid traffic or to collect another type of collectible. Cash can be spent on buying properties and by revisiting them after a while additional cash can be collected. Various extras (modifiers) can be selected from the main menu, such as a big head mode or permadeath.",

      "description": "<i>Rocket League</i> is the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It is a vehicle based, futuristic variant of football (soccer). Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with football the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to drive up the sides.\n\nCars have no means of attack and no health bar, but it is possible to ram other cars to hinder them. Vehicles also have the ability to jump and use nitro. Nitro boosts are limited, but can be refilled by driving over certain sections of the pitch. By winning matches experience is earned to level up and unlock new parts. The car can be fully customized in a garage with different types of bodies, colours, wheels, decals, nitro trails etc. which is new for this version. Next to one-time exhibition matches and online games, it has a full season mode. The player sets up a season and determines the length (number of weeks), difficulty (rookie, pro, all-star), play-offs and the team size, with multiple matches in succession. Matches generally last five minutes.\n\nThe game supports both offline (split-screen for up to four players) and online multiplayer. Matches can be played with two to up to eight players and online games support both ranked and unranked playlists. Multiplayer is platform independent. When playing alone team mates are controlled by the AI. The tutorial consists of several mini-games based on three categories: defence, offence, and aerial play. While playing a small arrow shows the location of the ball when it is in the air and the camera can be rotated around the car to keep track of the action. After scoring the ball is returned to the middle and the cars are flown back to their side of the pitch.",

      "description": "<i>Ride</i> is a motorcycle racing simulation that aims to recreate a realistic racing experience without any arcade elements. At the start the player designs a character and gets to choose between three bikes from the slowest category (under 700 CC). The main game modes are World Tour, Quick Mode (quick races and time trials) and Online. Most of the content is unlocked through the World Tour. By participating in different events, 'reputation' is earned to buy new bikes and accessories. Bikes can be fully customized based on the appearance, brakes and suspensions, engine, transmission and wheels. Every main category is further split up in different components. For the engine for instance the player can determine the air filter, cylinder head porting, electronic control unit, exhaust and oil type. Components and bikes come from licensed manufacturers, both historic and modern. The general statistics for bikes are acceleration, braking power, handling and top speed.\n\nThe world tour events consists of leagues such as naked bikes (middleweight and heavyweight groups), supersports, historic superbikes, modern superbikes, pro circuit, premium events (extremely limited bikes) and open races. Most of them only become available after acquiring the right type of bike. There are about 100 bikes in total, with displacements ranging from 250 to 1,299 cc and manufactured between 1987 and 2015. Each league is further split up in multiple groups of events. Racing events include single races, championships, drag races, endurance, head-to-head, time attack, track day (overtake a number of riders) on circuits inspired by real ones (GP tracks) and more general, open terrain races (city, country etc.). The Team Race game mode requires a team mate as the results of both riders combined determines the final standing. The team mate is a character that can be chosen, but is also possible to download the rider profile and appearance of a friend.\n\nThe game contains three simulation levels: Semi Pro, Standard and Pro. They influence the handling of the bike and sometimes lock guides at higher levels. Physics elements include auto brakes, joint brakes, an anti wheelie option, tuck-in, different settings for following the ideal trajectory (shown through coloured arrows on the track to show the best line and recommended speed), the type of transmission and influence over TCS (traction). The game also takes into account how the track evolves over multiple laps with rubbered in black marks that offer better grip. At lower levels it is possible to use multiple rewinds, allowing the player to rewind time after a mistake. Before each race the settings of the bike can be adjusted, based on the suspension (preload, spring stiffness, compression damping, rebound damping), handlebars and gears. While racing the player controls acceleration and braking (front and rear brake), shifting gears, steering, shifting weight, adjusting TCS and tuck-in. There are different camera options and it is possible to look to the sides or behind to keep an eye on the other racers.\n\nMultiplayer includes split-screen for two players, single races for up to twelve players and championships with multiple races in succession.",

      "description": "<i>Beach Buggy Racing</i> is the sequel to Beach Buggy Blitz. Just like the original game it is a racing game set in a tropical beach environment, but now as a more traditional style instead of an endless racer. Players race in different levels, grouped as cups unlocked gradually and with 12 environments in total. Coins can be collected along the way to buy new cars. The vehicles can be upgraded with coins to improve acceleration, top speed, handling and strength. Eventually four engine classes become available: 100, 250, 500 and 1000 HP. The colour of vehicles can be customized as well. Next to the main championship mode there are single races as well.\n\nWhile racing circa 30 types of power-ups can be picked up and used. It is also possible to unlock one right away by spending gems, the premium currency, in the mobile versions. Power-ups include nitro, a shield, firing rockets, a homing skull, a power-up that alters the gravity for the other racers, dropping oil etc. A grease monkey can be used to boost the car's performance. Up to three stars can be earned based on the performance during races to progress through the levels. There are six game modes such as circuit racing, time trials, elimination etc. In the stampede game mode all power-ups become 'angry bull' allowing the character to plough through the competition, collecting kills. Each character has a unique skill such as a trail of flowers, teleportation, flaming fire tracks, and confusion spells. By beating boss characters they are added to the team roster and become playable characters. Every now and then there is a bonus coconut game and a large spinning wheel with rewards. There are daily challenges and daily rewards.\n\nThe mobile version are free-to-play with in-app purchases. There is a basic currency (coins) and a premium currency (gems) that can both be bought with real money. It has an energy/stamina system based on tickets to enter races. It is possible to buy a one-time premium package to disable all advertising, removing the energy system and unlock multiplayer. There are also some starter packs and options to double the amount of coins earned forever. Most of the platforms support offline split-screen multiplayer games with up to four or six players.",

      "description": "<i>Batman: Arkham Knight</i> is an action-adventure and the fourth main game in the <i>Batman: Arkham</i> series based around the DC Comics superhero Batman. It marks the return of the original developer of the first two games. It is set one year after the events of the second game Batman: Arkham City. It starts when Scarecrow forces an evacuation of Gotham City by threatening to release a fear toxin. Many familiar characters and foes are present. The title refers to a new villain called Arkham Knight who backs Scarecrow. He wears a militaristic Batsuit and an Arkham symbol on his chest.\n\nThe game is set in an open world environment for Arkham City with main missions, side missions and the Riddler trophies that can be pursued freely. Familiar game elements return, such as the many melee combat sections, the use of gadgets and stealth abilities, and detective skills to examine clues in the environment and solve puzzles. Gadgets are used both during combat and while exploring. They include batarangs (now also used as a way to explore the environment), the batclaw, a disruptor, an electrical charge gun, explosive gel, freeze blast, grapnel gun, a line-launcher, a remote hacking device, smoke pellets, a voice synthesizer etc. Many of these return from previous games. Exploration is largely done using long flights with the cape.\n\nAn entirely new game element is the introduction of the batmobile as a playable vehicle for both exploration and combat. While on foot it can be summoned right away and Batman is able to eject to go into flight without interruption. The car is bulletproof, can smash through obstacles and is equipped with weapons. There are two modes to control the vehicle: Battle or Pursuit. Pursuit is used mostly for transportation and driving challenges. Battle provides tank-like controls for the car, with 360-degree range of movement, strafing and a large weapons arsenal. Next to the regular gameplay there are many sequences where the batmobile is used. The car can be controlled remotely and various upgrades such as an EMP gun can be equipped.\n\nThe combat retains the familiar combo and counter system. Enemy medics are new. They are able to shield certain enemies or revive unconscious ones. Fights are rewarded with experience points that are used to unlock new moves, health upgrades and new abilities for gadgets. Batman sometimes fights along allies (Catwoman, Nightwing, Robin) and the game introduces a Dual Play system where seamlessly switching during combat provides access to double takedowns.",

It uses many elements from the films, but has its own storyline not based on the movies. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, barren wasteland and combines sections on foot with vehicular action. The entire game world is available right away and the player can pursue the main quest, side missions or explore freely. Some game elements are inspired by the Just Cause series by the same developer. The protagonist is Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) and he is on his way to the Plains of Silence. In the beginning of the game his car, the Interceptor, is stolen. Bandits known as War Boys, led by Scabrous Scrotus (the son of Immortan Joe from <i>Fury Road</i>), leave him behind in the desert without his car, weapons or supplies. Max wants to find back his vehicle, take vengeance on  Scrotus and build Magnum Opus, the perfect car.\n\nA large part of the game is spent driving as Max teams up with the mechanic Chumbucket who rides along. Max has a dog as a companion and gets to build a new car to become the Magnum Opus. Various upgrades become available during the course of the game by spending scrap, the main game currency, next to fuel to keep driving. Others are provided by collecting car parts of enemies or by hijacking cars. Next to guns, car weapons include a flamethrower, a grappling hook, a mounted cannon etc.. While racing a slow-motion function is be activated to provide assist while aiming. Chumbucket repairs the car automatically. There is a large amount of customization that affects the driving (chassis, wheels, engine, handling, nitro, suspension) as well as combat, with spikes to protect against boarding, armour, ramming grills, explosive harpoons, and aesthetic options such as new car bodies and paint jobs. Certain sections are not accessible by car and require Max to climb and travel on foot with ranged weapons and melee combat based on attacking and forming combos, blocking and dodging. Markers above the enemies' heads announce actions and the fighting system is similar to the Batman: Arkham games. Health is replenished by eating small animals.\n\nThere is a leveling system for Max and tokens earned through challenges can be exchanged for perks. A mysterious stranger called Gryffa also often reveals slices of Max' past. The world is divided into different territories where the enemy threat can be lowered by completing missions such as clearing minefields, taking out snipers, tearing down scarecrows, attacking convoys and invading camps. Camps offer many approaches to get inside and clear them with both blunt action and stealth. There are other activities such as racing and time trials or collecting history relics. Sometimes devastating sandstorms occur, rewarding adventurous players with large amounts of scrap for venturing outside. Hot air balloons can be located to use them for fast travel. There is a day-and-night cycle, environmental hazards and a border to the game world that is not clearly defined, leading into The Big Nothing where Max can attempt to survive as long as possible. A territory is cleared entirely by defeating a boss in an enemy stronghold. It is also possible to visit friendly strongholds that provide quests and rewards for bringing down the enemy activity in the region.",

      "description": "<i>Need for Speed</i> is the 20th main title in the racing series and a reboot of the franchise. It is an open world racing game set entirely at night that returns to the underground racing and tuning culture best known from the Need for Speed Underground series. The player is a new racer in the fictional city Ventura Bay and soon gets introduced to the local street racing scene, hooking up with the characters Amy, Manu, Robyn, Spike and Travis. The story is told through cut-scenes with full motion video combined with digitized sections, shown from the main character's first-person perspective. Those five characters each aim to impress five real-life racing icons that are present as actors in the cut-scenes: Akira Nakai, Ken Block, Magnus Walker, Risky Devil and Shinichi Morohoshi. The player can follow five different paths with overlapping storylines and the goal is to make a reputation to challenge and beat these icons and become the new icon of Ventura Bay. The crew members regularly keep in touch through phone calls and text messages.\n\nNext to cash earned in races up upgrade cars and buy new ones, REP is an important currency to progress in the game. With each new level new events are opened up. REP can be earned for five types of activities: Build (customization), Crew (social interactions and synchronized driving), Outlaw (illegal activities), Speed and Style, as well as through actions in the open world environment, especially by combining maneuvers. Each of the activities is tied to one of the five characters of the crew as well as an icon, and the player is free to pursue one the five paths in any order.\n\nThere is a lot of emphasis on tuning the licensed cars for the aesthetics, performance and handling. Many upgrades are based on parts that first need to be won or unlocked. The garage has room for five cars. Customization options include Paint & Wrap to change an entire body kit or design each car element and decals in a custom way. There is also a Wrap Editor with many different types of paint jobs. Handling Tuning focuses most on the difference between drifting or opting for good grip. It is possible to upgrade a starter car to match the fastest ones in the game, so it is not required to sell and buy cars just to keep up. Racing is mainly arcade based and typical race types include standard races to reach the finish first (Sprint), drifting challenges and time based courses. Outlaw missions often include police chases and in some cases it is possible to pay the police a bribe so they halt the chase. There are also daily challenges.\n\nThe game requires a permanent internet connection at all times, even when playing solo. That also means the game cannot be paused during a race. The Autolog from previous titles, where scores and achievements are recorded and shared with friends, is still present. The online multiplayer continues the AllDrive concept of Need for Speed: Rivals. Instead of interacting with all online players, the game creates a lobby or copy of the game world where a maximum of eight online players are present. Participating in races is then done by starting or joining a crew. It is not a permanent organization and mostly resembles the idea of public and private matches. With each new game session a new crew needs to be started or joined, either privately with friends or for instance by joining a public crew. It is also possible to start a race and then bring in all friends of a crew.",

      "description": "<i>TRON RUN/r</i> is a racing game based on the <i>TRON</i> science fiction franchise. It stays close to the original computer-inspired world and the trademark bright neon visuals. It contains three game modes: Disc, Cycle and Stream. In the Disc mode the player controls a character from a behind view and there are several levels unlocked gradually on a large disc. To complete the level the exit needs to be reached. Similar to endless runner games, the character runs at a constant speed and needs to be moved left and right to dodge obstacles. Jumping is used to move between platforms and keeping it pressed activates gliding. Boosting left and right can be done to strafe very quickly and a disc can be thrown to destroy enemies and obstacles. Unlike most runner games there is a free movement and it is not confined to lanes. Only a few hits can be taken or the character dies. The same applies to dropping down gaps. Other game elements include wall running, grinding rails, timing jumps to receive boosts by passing circles, jumping over obstacles and sliding below them. Level have a fixed end point and are not randomly generated.\n\nThe Cycle mode introduces races with motorbike-like light cycles. Similar to the Disc mode the light cycle travels at a constant speed. The player accelerates the bike further and used another key to drift, to take sharper turns. Cycle races have a fixed end point, but are also a race against time. Gates need to be passed to collect additional seconds. When time runs out, the game is over. Other game elements are the ability to perform tricks, using ramps to jumps, and attacking other riders. These other light cycles leave behind a coloured trail that acts as a barrier and needs to be avoided.\n\nIn both game modes up to three stars are earned based on the total performance and points. Next to moving through levels, points are gathered in both modes by picking up items and keeping a combo going. The characters can be customized for the model and the colour. With each completed track bits are earned as a currency. These can be spent on power-ups and companions. Power-ups provide for instance new weapons or perks that can be activated and are permanent for a single session. Companions are entities that race along and help out, for instance by destroying enemies and obstacles. A companion is lost immediately after the first hit. Next to earning bits, the currency can be bought for real money through microtransactions.\n\nThe final game mode is Stream. This is an endless, randomized mode alternating between Disc and Cycle sections and a race against time for both sections.. The character needs to survive as long as possible. There are also weekly challenges.",

      "description": "<i>Obliteracers</i> is a bright, arcade racing game where reaching the finish line is not a game element. Rather, it is a party game for up to sixteen players, both local and online, all racing with an exotic character and vehicle on the same screen. The game has twelve maps and different modes where the racers use power-ups to fight each other, shove each other off the track, or attempt to gain enough speed so an opponent disappears from the bottom of the screen. The action takes place on the same screen for all players involved, so racers are always together on the same part of the track. When someone is eliminated or disappears from the bottom of the screen, the racer either respawns or returns in the next round.\n\nIn Survival games races are played in rounds and the last one standing scores a point. In a Knockout match, points are scored for each destroyed opponent and this game mode too is played in rounds. The Endurance game mode is similar, but there defeated racers respawn right away and it is not based on rounds. Leader matches are chaotic games where only the leader scores. When the leader gets ahead of the pack that racer steals points for everyone else's knockouts. Controls consist of acceleration, braking and moving left and right. It is also possible to reverse. There is a jump button and it is also used to drift through corners. After picking up a power-up, it can be activated or be absorbed (restoring health). The absorption key is also used to drop the power-up or to activate a shield. A shield is available at all times and blocks weapons and force impact, but while a shield is activated it is not possible to accelerate or brake.\n\nPower-ups can be picked up regularly. They include mines, a machine gun, a dangerous trail, homing and quick rockets, using electricity, a gravity push, and flames on the side of the vehicle. There is an offline single-player Career mode where only the character Sarge is available. The player races against bots and earns bombs to unlock new challenges and tracks. The Versus mode is the multiplayer mode with sixteen different characters to choose from. There is a drop-in-drop-out system to join. In additional to gamepads, the game supports controllers such as laptops, tablets and smartphones to use as controllers to join the game, using a local Wi-Fi connection. In round-based game modes the defeated players can lock cross-hairs on the remaining racers to call in airstrikes, influencing the game even when defeated.",

      "description": "<i>Trackmania Turbo</i> is an entry in the long-running racing series and the second title also for consoles, following the 2009 Wii game TrackMania: Build to Race. Like the previous entries the focus is entirely on time trials, either playing alone, with other players in the same room or with many players simultaneously in online multiplayer. When racing together it is never possible to obstruct someone, all other cars appear as ghost versions. <i>Turbo</i> is based on four different environments, each with their own scenery and tracks, and a single car for each environment with specific handling, identical for all players. That way, the circumstances are always the same for all players and there are never unfair advantages.\n\nThe four environments are Canyon Grand Drift, International Stadium, Rollercoaster Lagoon, and Valley Down & Dirty. Some of these incorporate elements from previous titles. On Valley tracks the car has extreme grip and often has to use dirt roads where it is hard to maintain speed without slipping, Canyon tracks are often open and wide like those in Trackmania\u00b2: Canyon with long drifts through corners at a high speed, Rollercoaster Lagoon tracks are similar to Valley, but in a tropical environment and with magnetic tracks, and International Stadium has the fastest car with the environment the series is best known for.\n\nThe single-player campaign contains about 200 tracks divided over five different cups for each environment. The player races to get a fast time recognized with a bronze, silver or gold medal. Based on the medal count additional tracks are then unlocked gradually. While racing it is possible to enable a ghost car of the best performance, or a ghost for each of the medal times. The entire campaign can also be driven using the Double Driver concept. There, two players control the same car on the same screen and the system averages the input of both players simultaneously to steer the car. There are also worldwide challenges and records. Only four buttons or keys are used to steer the car: acceleration, brake, and moving left and right. However, while driving at a fast speed the brake can be tapped to enter a slide and drift through corners by maintaining the acceleration. In some game modes stunts such as rolls can be performed in the air to save up boost.\n\nMultiplayer includes hot seat and split-screen modes, along with online multiplayer supporting 100 players on a single track racing simultaneously with different game modes. Most of these have the players try to get the best time with an unlimited number of tries as long as there is time left. There are global rankings where players are assigned per country and then further per province, county or state. By progressing through the single-player campaign many customization options for the cars can be unlocked. After crashing it is possible to respawn at the latest checkpoint or to restart the entire track. There is an editor to create and share tracks with other players.",

Each level has a different theme and different gameplay. After the initial driving part with a behind view that is identical for all levels, there is a second part after reaching a checkpoint with the same gameplay, but a different style. There are sections played from a top-down view, flying in the air with circular rotation, racing with a front view dodging lasers, shooting like a top-down space shooter and so on. A single mistake is allowed when briefly brushing an obstacle, but a second one is punished right away as well crashing directly into an obstacle. After completing a level on normal, the variations hard, insane and practice are unlocked for that level. There is also an endless endurance mode.\n\nOn iOS the game is free-to-play with a single in-app purchase to unlock all content",

      "description": "<i>Table Top Racing: World Tour</i> is the sequel to the mobile and handheld game Table Top Racing. It is a racing game with miniature cars racing in huge everyday environments in the tradition of the Micro Machines games. This version, for PC and consoles, has both a single-player campaign as well as online games with up to eight players.\n\nThe single-player campaign is based on six championships based on three divisions that also reflect the car types: cult classics (amateur), street racers (pro) and supercars (expert). Each cup consists of several types of events where up to three stars can be earned, for a total of 258. These are used to unlock the next championships. By winning races the player earns experience as well as coins. Coins can be spent to buy new cars, upgrade the statistics (top speed, acceleration, handling and armour), buy new skins and rims, and add weapon wheels.\n\nEvents consist of regular races with power-ups, pure races without power-ups, time trials, chasing after a car and so on. Along the way power-ups can be found, providing a (homing rocket), turning opponents into ice cubes, dropping mines or acid, a nitro etc. Using power-ups, combined with the weapon wheels and sometimes in combos, also provides coins. In later races a power-up can be conserved and then picked up a second time to turn it into a super power-up. Tracks have objects that can be knocked over, there are short-cuts and hidden cash bonuses. Next to the main championships there are separate, special events for more coins.",

      "description": "<i>Trials of the Blood Dragon</i> is a game in the <i>Trials</i> obstacle traversing racing series, but thematically based on another Ubisoft game, the first-person shooter Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, which is itself a spin-off of Far Cry 3. The game is set in 2019 and uses the same science fiction style of the 1980's as the original <i>Blood Dragon</i> game, with bright visuals and the same type of electro based music. The characters, story and gameplay are often deliberately over-the-top, with the same humorous tone as the original game. The protagonists are the twelve-year-old twins Roxanne and Slayer, the children of Rex Power Colt from <i>Blood Dragon</i>. Their father died in the second Vietnam War against the communists and they were raised by general Mason Ryback who trained them to become Mark VI cybercommandos, with cybernetic technology in their bodies. Just like their father they go after the communists in the fourth Vietnam war to prevent them from turning the Blood Dragons' energy into powerful weapons.\n\nFrom a central hub different missions can be played through posters that are unlocked gradually. Each poster represents a different setting with multiple levels, such as Vietnam, Miami (based on Hotline Miami), Japan, Mars, a temple (based on <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>), hell and so on. For each mission a specific character is used. Slayer mostly goes for action, while for Roxanne there are often hacking, puzzle-solving and stealth elements. The core motorbike mechanic of the <i>Trials</i> game is present, but with lots of new gameplay elements. In the familiar sections the player controls a bike through acceleration, braking and leaning back or forward to maintain a good balance. This is used to travel through a course, cross gaps and clear obstacles. There are often explosions and collapsing bridges, but also helicopters or Blood Dragons that interfere with the gameplay. This title adds many more types of vehicles, such as a tank, a bicycle, a remote control car, a mine cart etc. These are often switched in the middle of levels. Entirely new is sections that are done on foot, where the characters are controlled as they clear platform sections, interact with the environment, use a jetpack and shoot enemies. Balancing is not needed then, instead the character can jump and duck. Regular racing is also more complex through the use of a grappling hook that can be used to swing and often a gun needs to be fired as well.\n\nAs in the original games the player is encouraged to clear levels as quickly as possible. Not only is there a time limit, but dying as little as possible is rewarded with larger bonuses for the experience that adds to the general player profile. Levels are split up in large amount of checkpoints so it is possible to restart quickly as time continues to count down. Levels often have multiple paths and sometimes hidden items, so replaying them is encouraged to find the fastest route. Between levels there are often animated cut-scenes that further the story. There are leaderboards to compare scores with friends, in a single country or worldwide. Extras such as concept art, stickers and music tracks can also be unlocked.",

      "description": "<i>Riptide GP: Renegade</i> is a hydrojet racing game. It is the sequel to Riptide GP 2 and the third game in the <i>Riptide</i> racing series as the spiritual successor to the Hydro Thunder titles. The game modes are a single-player career mode, a challenge mode to get the best times on leaderboards, quick races, a synchronous online multiplayer mode for up to eight players, and a local split-screen mode for two to four players. The <i>Renegade</i> part of the title hints at the introduction of a story to the career mode. At the start of the game the player chooses a male (Impact) or female (Poison) rider. In the interactive tutorial the devious Krex gets the player's character caught in an illegal race. Years later, the rider needs to return after being banned from the GP League and take revenge on Krex. There are often static story sequences between races, with conversations between characters and bosses.\n\nThe career mode consists of several events where up to three stars can be earned based on the result, needed to keep unlocking new races until there is a showdown with a boss character. Defeating such a character adds it to the roster, with a custom hydrojet as a new vehicle to race. Racing consists of controls for acceleration, braking and turning. At various parts of the tracks stunts can be performed and these fill a booster meter. There are regular ramps, but also huge waves or bridges as there is a lot of interactivity on the tracks with events that influence the environment. After crashing a separate button is used to recover and the same button is used to activate boost. There are eight tracks: Downtown Rush, Unicorn Base, Sky Mines, Grindhouse, Tropico, The Ruins, Alpha Station, and Firewater, each with their own theme. There are shortcuts, alternate paths that open up after certain events, and also other vehicles, dynamic elements and explosions, rain, storms or fire, influencing the racing conditions.\n\nEvent types include regular track races, slalom, elimination, stunts against a time limit, and mini championships where the results of different events are combined. Certain cups are much harder and are offered as a bonus challenge. Tracks often have signs that help with the general direction or to highlight parts where stunts can be performed. Each hydrojet has different statistics for acceleration, top speed, handling and boost. Money earned during races can be used to improve these a few times, until a more powerful hydrojet is unlocked where the process is repeated. Winning also provides experience for a global player level. With each new level skill points become available to unlock new stunts, or to improve the boost bonus or boost start. It is also possible to level up the drafting ability where trailing behind an opponent adds a visual effect and provides more speed to catch up. The hydrojet colours can be customized and different types of decals can be unlocked. Optionally an easter egg can be found on each track.",

      "description": "<i>Clustertruck</i> is a very fast first-person platformer where a character needs to reach a goal by hopping on top of a moving column of speeding trucks. Movement resembles trick jumping or parkour through the quick succession of actions, air control, the ability to double jump, dash, sprint and hanging on for a high launch and so on. Each level is a short course based on \"the floor is lava\" principle; as soon as the ground is touched the level is lost. The main campaign consists of 90 levels grouped per ten for the different worlds: desert, forest, winter, laser, medieval, ancient, sci-fi, steampunk and hell. Each world introduces new elements such as multiple groups of trucks driving in different directions, gaps, moving structures, time limits, swinging hammers, flamethrowers, lasers, cannons shooting trucks and so on. Levels are unlocked gradually. While the main levels are always identical, because of the physics and player actions the gameplay is never completely the same.\n\nBased on speed and style, points are earned. These can be used to unlock movement and utility abilities. Only one of each can be equipped at all times. Movement abilities are air dash, disrespected blink (teleportation), double jump, grappling hook, jetpack, levitation, truck boost, and trucker flip. The utility abilities are back truck, epic mode, portable truck (a projectile that spawns a truck to land on), supertruck, time slow, and trucksolute zero (freezes all trucks). Each ability has a recharge time.\n\nThere is an in-game editor and integration with the Steam Workshop to create and share levels with other users. The best times can be compared on global leaderboards. There is Twitch streaming integration with audience participation where viewers can vote for events in real-time. Events include bouncy trucks, thin trucks, slower or faster speed, altered gravity and so on. The developers can influence the Twitch streams with their own commands if they are sent with the official Landfall Twitch account, influencing time and gravity, and changing colours.",

      "description": "<i>Mantis Burn Racing</i> is a top-down racing with a single-player career as well as multiplayer races either through local split-screen or online. The single-player career consists of seven seasons. Each one consists of multiple races with different types of objectives. These need to be completed to collect a set amount of gears needed to unlock the final race of a season. Multiple types of cars can be acquired based on three categories: dune buggies, road racers and trucks and there are also three types of classes. Winning races is rewarded with experience and a currency. New cars can be bought and they usually become available at certain levels based on the total amount of experience.\n\nThe main car statistics are speed, acceleration, grip, suspension and boost. The car and boost colour can be customized. Controls are limited to acceleration and breaking. There are many obstacles on the tracks and it is possible to drift. The type of surface and elevation also plays a role. Cars do not have a damage system. While racing, a boost meter fills up gradually and when full a short speed boost can be activated. The game environments are the sun-scorched Sand Town and the asphalt city streets of New Shangri-la. There is a fixed and a dynamic camera angle available. There are eight types of races including accumulator (collect points), endurance, knockout, lap and sprint races, overtake, time trials etc. To keep receiving gears and to unlock all elements a top 3 usually needs to be reached. Players can also participate in weekly challenges.\n\nThere are many types of upgrades affecting the car's performance: boost, engine, gear box, suspension and tyres that are unlocked and can be used to alter a car's performance. Each car has a small amount of slots to fit them, but more become available after upgrading. From the selection of upgrades any one can be applied or combined. They can also be removed afterwards, but then they are lost.",

      "description": "<i>Mafia III</i> is the third main game in the crime series with free-roaming gameplay combining fighting, shooting and racing, on foot and using vehicles. This time the protagonist is Lincoln Clay. He is a veteran of the Vietnam War and part of a black mob. The game is set in 1968 in New Bordeaux, a fictional environment inspired by New Orleans, which consists of ten districts. There are busy city environments, but also large stretches of swamps, the countryside, canals ... When circumstances force Clay to pay back a debt to the Marcano crime family, he is betrayed and his mob friends along with his surrogate father Sammy are all killed. Left for dead, he is rescued by his friend Father James and gets in touch with his former Vietnam CIA handler John Donovan. Clay is out for revenge to destroy the Marcano family and seize control of New Bordeaux. The story is told as flashbacks by survivors in different segments incorporating cut-scenes.\n\nNext to the various missions there is a larger, faction/assets system where decisions influence the alliance with three important characters. There is Cassandra who leads the Haitian mob, Thomas Burke with ties to the IRA and the Italian gangster Vito Scalleta, the protagonist of Mafia II, who had to leave Empire Bay after killing the don Falcone. Lincoln is mostly on his own and needs their support to hold the territory he captures. Territory does not only provide an income, each faction assigned to it also provides different types of services such as muscle, providing cars and locations or arms dealers, sabotaging phone lines to prevent back-up, bribing the police etc. similar to a skill tree where new abilities are unlocked. A district is taken over after a number of rackets have been captured along with killing the capo who leads it. Each faction also provides a constant stream of missions in the open world with a cash reward.\n\nAs in the previous games there is free-roaming gameplay where any vehicle can be stolen and driven. Different types of gameplay styles are possible, involving melee fights or ranged gunplay, with brute force or using a stealth approach combined with a cover system. Using a wiretapping junction box or with the Inside Man bonus it is possible to eavesdrop and see enemies through walls using Clay's Intel Vision, similar to the Eagle Vision of Assassin's Creed. Enemies can be lured away by whistling. Missions include infiltration, killing targets, performing heists, destroying goods, stealing cars, intercepting drugs etc. Large buildings are often used for missions played inside that specific location. There is also a large amount of collectibles including different magazines, paintings and old album covers. Not all missions are scripted, some events are triggered based on actions in the environment or attacks by hit squads. When the police becomes involved, there is a blue search zone that needs to be escaped. NPCs will often report crimes and they can be killed to prevent this, but this often leads to a chain reaction.",

      "description": "<i>Moto Racer 4</i> is a title in the long-running arcade motorcycle racing series that was started in 1997. It keeps the core element of letting players race with heavy bikes on asphalt tracks, along with slower but more technically challenging dirt bike off-road races, but it also introduces a lot of new elements. Multiplayer is supported against another player locally through split-screen and online with up to ten players for multiple game modes. Quick races consist of a championship, hot lap, a single race, and time attack.\n\nProgressing through the game to unlock everything is done in the career mode. It has events such as Catch-up, Ghost Bike, Golden Helmet, King of the Road, Last Man Riding, Single Race, and Wolf Pack. In Catch-up opponents get a head start and the player needs to catch up and overtake them to reach the first place with a limited amount of time. Ghost Bike also starts at the back of a pack, but here the player has to reach a specific position without going off the track or bumping into other racers. In Golden Helmet the first racer to reach a checkpoint receives a golden helmet and needs to hold on to it as long as possible. It is taken away when crashing or being hit by other racers. In King of the Road all players start with the same amount of time on a clock. When in first place the clock counts down, but other players receive a speed boost. Then the first player to lose all time wins the event. Last Man Riding is a race where the last racer is eliminated after a certain amount of time until there is only one left. Wolf Pack is a chase event where one racer gets a head start. All other racers are behind, need to catch up and hold the lead.\n\nIn each event up to three stars can be earned based on the performance. Stars are needed to keep progressing and unlocking new events. There are ten riders to choose from, each with two types of bikes (street and dirt) with different statistics for acceleration, handling, max speed and the T.U.R.B.O boost module. Upgrade points can be earned to improve the statistics and there are different colour schemes for customization. Those points are earned by showing off and reaching a style objective in events. Style points are earned through moves such as tricks in the air (in dirt bike races), drifting, high speed, staying in a slipstream, brushing other riders or traffic and so on. There are also penalties for crashing or going off the track. Typically for the series wheelies can also be done, not only for style points but also for a speed boost with a cooldown period. It is a risky manoeuvre as it briefly makes the handling harder. Boosts are also earned by doing perfect landings on two wheels. Later on more advanced tricks can be unlocked such as a boost landing, return on the track, slipstream, start, and wheelie. It is possible to use a horn, provoke other riders, swerve to knock them off their bikes, and skid around corners by braking. Environments range from a sunny Bay Area to Asia and many of them have multiple routes and shortcuts.",

      "description": "<i>Eagle Flight</i> is a VR game set in a fictional version of Paris that was abandoned by humankind fifty years ago, although it is not specified what happened exactly. There are famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame cathedral and the Pant\u00e9on. The buildings are crumbling, animals have escaped from the zoo and vegetation overgrowth shows nature is reclaiming the city. The player takes control of an eagle, shown through a first-person perspective with the beak still visible, and can soar through the sky of the free-roaming environment without restrictions.\n\nThere is a Story mode that links together 23 story missions and seventeen expert challenges in five chapters, but also a Free Flight mode. From the main map different types of events can be accessed that mainly revolve around time trial mechanics. There are also missions set in catacombs, the metro and underground tunnels, both during the day and at night, and there are many shortcuts and small passages where taking risks is rewarded with a speed boost through wind tunnels. Up to three stars are earned based on the performance and stars are needed to unlock new event types with 129 stars in total.\n\nMovement is done entirely through head tracking, by looking in a certain direction and tilting, while a controller is used to send a sound based Eagle Screech attack. As the eagle cries out it is shot as a projectile and the straight path needs to be predicted so it crosses the trajectory of an enemy such as another bird. It is also possible to speed up or slow down. Later on a shield is discovered; it blocks a single attack and then dissolves. In an event like Gone Fishing a course needs to be completed as fast as possible while catching a number of fish midair as they jump out of a river. In another a friendly bird needs to be protected while vultures attack and they need to be taken out. There are also chase sequences and it is possible to race ghosts to beat the fastest times.\n\nThere are also many collectible feathers and fish to locate. Overall, the player needs to conquer the city's districts in different ways. This varies per district and includes exploring, building a nest on landmarks and facing rivals like bats, falcons and vultures. A chapter always ends with a ring challenge. Enemies have different abilities. Bats rarely attack but have an echo shield that blocks your sound attacks. Falcons have the same abilities and can shield themselves against the Eagle Screech. Vultures do not attack back, but go very fast. The game's most dangerous enemy is the black falcon.\n\nThe game supports online multiplayer for up to six players. Two teams of three players can play a Capture the Flag variant where a dead rabbit appears somewhere in the city, marked by a column of light. Both teams attempt to get the rabbit back to their own nest to score. Players work together, but there are no means to communicate.",

      "description": "<i>Carmageddon: Max Damage</i> is a violent car racing game. For PC it is an updated version of Carmageddon: Reincarnation, which was a reboot of the series, while for PS4 and Xbox One this is the first version of the game for the platform. While racing the player gets points for wrecking opponents and killing pedestrians. Points are then used to unlock new tracks. Sometimes an opponent car will be marked as steal worthy and if the player manage to wreck it it will be added to the player's garage. To make the races more interesting the tracks are littered with power-ups such as \"slaughter mortar\", \"kangaroo on command\" and \"Mutant Tail Thing\".\n\nRaces can be of one of the following types:<ul>\n<li>Checkpoint stampede: the first player to reach a preset number of checkpoints wins. Once a checkpoint has been reached the next one becomes visible.</li><br>\n<li>Classic Carma: the player must either complete all of the laps or kill all of the opponents or kill all of the pedestrians. Killing pedestrians and hitting opponents will grant the player both points and extra time.</li><br>\n<li>Death Race: all laps need to be completed to win.</li><br>\n<li>Ped Chase: the first player to kill a certain number of pedestrians wins. The only pedestrians that count towards this goal are those who are marked. Each time a marked pedestrian is killed the mark will move to a new one.</li></ul>In all game modes points can be stolen from the opponents by crashing into them and they in turn can steal points from the player too.\n\nThe game was released just in time for the US presidential election and the Steam version features three exclusive modes:<ul>\n<li>Hillaryious Mode: all the pedestrians are Hillary Clinton.</li>\n<li>Mass Debate Mode: the pedestrians are made up out of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</li>\n<li>Trumped-Up Mode: all the pedestrians are Donald Trump.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Watch_Dogs 2</i> is the follow-up to Watch_Dogs with similar gameplay mechanics, but a different protagonist, a different setting and a lighter and more humorous tone for the themes and story. It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oakland, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens.\n\nThere are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative.\n\nThe different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway's in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines  and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around.\n\nAdditional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options.\n\nThe single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player's system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out. Players can also work together to neutralize other players causing havoc in a Bounty Hunter session.",

      "description": "<i>Driveclub VR</i> is in a way a subset of the original Driveclub game containing both off-line and on-line races. As the name implies, the game gives an importance on creating or joining online clubs with other players and earning points by competing in various races. For offline mode, the same type of races still appear, such as racing with other opponents (AI offline or other players online), time trials, free driving which lets you explore the surrounding of each track with a VR helmet without pressure of winning, or drifting.\n\nThere are dozens of cars available, but at the beginning only two are unlocked. The rest become available as you drive and in doing so level up. Character creation is also available, but unlike in role-playing games, you can choose only sex, one of the several faces, clothes, and helmet style. When racing you can use factory color of a car, club colors if you are part of an online club, or do your own coloring and design. Tracks are split and selected per countries (Scotland, India, Japan, etc.) and vary in terrain from city streets and actual racing tracks to snowy mountains. While the weather effect selection is only limited to clear and cloudy, time of day can be set by clock which will result in racing at sunset, noon, dawn, or night.\n\nEach of the cars can be examined from the outside by rotating and rising the circular pedestal they're on. You cannot open doors or peek inside, but that is more than explorable when driving a car from the cockpit perspective. This is VR game so zooming in or out basically means moving your head toward the object you wish to see more closely. Driving perspective include cockpit view which lets you see full car interior and rely on rear mirrors and turning your head, hood view which is down to earth front view showing nothing but a small silhouette of the front bumper or something similar, and 3rd-person perspective which although in VR looks just as real since you follow your car from the bird's perspective right behind it unless it swerves.\n\nDriving off road is not forgiving and you'll often be prompted to get back on track with a click of a button or to manually drive yourself back. During cockpit view the distance, the speed and other info will be visible on a GPS-like device in your car, while switching to 3rd-person or hood view will show all the info at the top of the screen. The VR does not know boundaries, meaning that while inside the cockpit view you can literally move your head outside the car's window or roof and make yourself a unique outside of a car driving perspective.",
