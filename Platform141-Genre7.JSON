      "description": "The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by \"Eos\". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive \"Red Faction\". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and its workers, any little incident could ignite...\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> is a first-person shooter. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in a less protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most of which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> features a game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths,  tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.",

      "description": "The story of this game is based on <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>, the first of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.\n\nMost of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.\n\nSome of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.\n\nThe PlayStation ports of the SNES version have updated controller and display options, leaderboards, new save options, and Trophies.",

Chosen to be the blue-print for the Clone Army, Jango must now prove himself in order to gain the biggest job on the streets, wiping out the deadly cult, Bando Gora. Every other bounty hunter in the galaxy is willing and able to do the job, so you must work hard to gain the contract from Darth Tyranus.\n\nTo win the contract, you must complete a range of missions and collect the bounties on worlds very familiar to Star Wars fans. Jango has his trusty dual pistols to help him out, but also has the ability to use his flame thrower, jet pack, poison darts and much more.  Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level.  Jango must identify them with his helmet gear, and catch them alive...or dead.  Bounties allow the player to unlock bonus materials.\n\nThe 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs.  Bounty Hunter also connects to the movies in that it explains how Jango became the model for the Clone Army of the Republic, and how he became acquainted with Zam Wesell, who makes an appearance in the movies.",

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.\n\nAs the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.\n\nAs was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

One day, Cain has a strange dream that brings back memories from his childhood, when his native country Solcia was invaded by the neighboring Aldine. All he remembers is that \"everyone went to the island\". This mysterious Island of No Return is presently of great interest to the king, who is trying to find why the Elders sent a research team there. The island is rumored to harbor a ring with unseen powers, and the king secretly dispatches Cain to investigate the fate of the people who had ventured there and disappeared without a trace.\n\n<i>Eternal Ring</i> is a first-person action role-playing game similar in concept to King's Field series. It is focused on exploring interconnected dungeons, fighting enemies within. Compared to King's Field games, its world is smaller and less open. With a few exceptions, the only type of weapon Cain can use are swords. However, weapons play a relatively small role in the game, and there is also no armor. The gameplay system largely relies on magic spells that the player can gain by equipping special rings and imbuing them with gems.\n\nThe spells and the gems containing them come in six different elemental flavors: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, and Darkness. The player creates rings by experimenting with different types of gems, resulting in various effects. Up to six gems can be placed on both sides of a ring. Gems also have different levels which affect the outcome of the experiment. The resulting rings may modify Cain's attributes, increase his affinity for a particular element, provide auxiliary bonuses, or grant Cain powerful attack spells. ",

Each weapon has its disadvantages. The gun, for example, will only have so many bullets per life, and the knife will decrease in strength with every use. During your mission, you will also earn experience points, and meet and free hostages along the way. These hostages will heal you, fix your knife, and give you a machine gun. Some floors end with you defeating a boss, while others end at elevators. You must reach the top of the building where you will confront the leader.",

(Story) mode, and Multi-Play mode.\n\nIn W.G.P mode, you pick your bike that you want to use, and then race up to ten world circuits, including France, Germany, Italy, U.S.A, Spain, Sweden, and more. You race against the top riders. Try to aim for the top.\n\nR.P.G. mode is interactive. You travel between locations, and explore them, and speak to any people here. You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help of the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.\n\nMulti-Play mode lets you \"link\" cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.",

      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

He has built an orphanage on the remote island of Okinawa, which he manages together with his adopted daughter Haruka. But it seems that life will never be peaceful for him. Shady politicians are conspiring to take away the land on which his orphanage is built. A person whom Kazuma believed dead has miraculously returned from the grave. And once again Kazuma finds himself in the middle of a battle between organized crime divisions. He has to go back to Tokyo, to the Kamurocho district, for his third adventure.\n\nThe third Yakuza game retains the basic premise of its predecessors: it is an action RPG set in a free-roaming environment. As before, the core of the gameplay are hand-to-hand battles and building Kazuma's abilities by acquiring and distributing experience points (divided into Mind, Technique, and Body). Kazuma can still freely roam the city, go to restaurants, seduce pretty hostesses, and even play old  Sega games in arcades. New mini-games have been added, such as playing poker, singing in karaoke bars, etc.\n\nThe combat system is similar to the one in the first two games, but with more techniques and more refined weapon handling. Kazuma can now equip up to three different weapons at the same time; he can also repair and create weapons. At certain points Kazuma will also have to chase enemies through the city, balancing his stamina and trying not to bump into pedestrians. It is also (finally) possible to freely rotate the camera as Kazuma explores the city.",

      "description": "Although <i>Mount&Blade: Warband</i> is called a stand-alone expansion pack to Mount&Blade, it is more of an enhanced remake of the original.\n\nAs stated, the core single player experience is unchanged to the original. <i>Mount&Blade: Warband</i> still is open-ended, nonlinear and focuses on realistic medieval warfare, combining character development elements with strategy management, exploration of the game world, and full real-time combat. Again the playing field is two-fold with an overhead map of the country where the player only sees figurative representations of castles, towns, own as well as enemy armies, etc., and the 3D real-time battles with up to a total of 150 units on the battlefield.\n\nBoth single and multiplayer modes feature improved graphics with motion-capture animations and more detailed textures. Combat itself has also been slightly altered with improved mechanics for soldier morale and the ability to use most throwing weapons in close combat.\n\n<b>New Faction and Diplomacy Features</b><br>\nTo the several different non-player character (NPC) kingdoms of the original, a new faction (the Sarranid) has found its way into the game which includes an expansion of the map with a new desert region for the player to explore and conquer. New gameplay mechanics include the ability to become king and create a new faction including convincing lords of other factions to become the players vassals. The player may also upgrade own companions to vassals and grant them lands (applies only to creating a new faction). In addition to becoming king, the player may now also marry a lady (or a lord, if playing a woman) through poetry or bravery, which will open up a whole new range of diplomatic possibilities, if the player is in ownership of a castle or town.\n\nSince the player still has total freedom to do as they wish, several new types of quests are waiting to be found and solved, many new companions are waiting in the taverns and a horde of new equipment to be collected or bought.\n\n<b>Multiplayer</b><br>\nMultiplayer is a new feature previously unavailable in the vanilla version. The game expands many aspects of the core game, improves the overall graphics and features multiplayer for up to 64 people (or bots) in which they can fight their 3D battles in the game modes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Conquest, Battle, and Siege. Each mode is class-based and the player has to decide whether the player wants to fight as archer, cavalry or infantry. The class choice influences the gear the player starts with, but as in the single player game, the player can always pick up what lies on the ground. Another way to get better gear is to buy it after each death with the money earned through killing enemies.",

      "description": "In 1985 18 men were shot dead in a ramen shop. This event marked a turning point for the Ueno Seiwa clan, but the truth behind the incident has remained hidden. In 2010 four men, a chivalrous money-lender, a condemned man sitting on death row, a crooked cop, and the Dragon of Dojima, are drawn together as a plot 25 years in the making nears fruition.\n\n<i>Yakuza 4</i> introduces three new characters to the <i>Yakuza</i> franchise: Shun Akiyama, Taiga Saejima, and Masayoshi Tanimura. Each character has their own storyline that ties into the overall events taking place, and in combat each controls similarly to Kiryu, although with their own simplified move set and personal flourishes: Akiyama has several moves involving taunting, Saejima can use his immense strength to lift heavy objects and people, and Tanimura can counter attacks while blocking as well as chain a combo into a HEAT action. \n\nAlthough the game predominantly takes place in the fictional Tokyo district of Kamurocho, the area has seen some expansion in the way of newly accessible rooftops, an underground mall and parking garage, and a sewer system. As in previous <i>Yakuza</i> games, side stories and mini-games can be found by wandering the streets and entering businesses. Hostess clubs and a massage parlor also make their return after having been excluded from the western release of <i>Yakuza 3</i>; the only content cut from the western release of <i>Yakuza 4</i> is the Answer x Answer arcade game and the theme song \"Butterfly City\".",

Severe drinking problems caused Tomoya's father to become violent; during one of the quarrels, he injured his son. Their relationship has seemingly improved since then, but Tomoya's injuries, mental and physical, have led him to a delinquent life. This changes when he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who gets sick easily. Tomoya begins to help her reform a drama club she failed to join last year, and gradually changes his view about life.\n\n<i>Clannad</i> is a visual novel. The game is dedicated to the development of the story, displayed as still images accompanied by text. The player's interaction is confined to occasional \"decision points\", which prompt him to make choices for Tomoya, altering subsequent events. The game is divided into two parts; the second one describes the lives of its main characters some time after the conclusion of the first one. In order to access the second part, the player has to play through all the scenarios of the first one, which are only possible to achieve by replaying it and making different choices each time.",

      "description": "<i>Pinball Arcade</i> is based on the Pinball Hall of Fame series and includes accurate simulations of pinball tables from Gottlieb, Williams, Stern Pinball (which also includes its previous incarnations: Stern Electronics, Data East Pinball, and Sega Pinball) and Bally. The latter two companies were not previously featured. It includes four tables, one from each company, with support for additional tables through commercial downloadable content. The included tables are, in the order they appear on the game:<ul>\n<li><i>Tales of the Arabian Nights</i> (Williams, 1996) (previously included in Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection)</li>\n<li><i>Ripley's Believe it or Not!</i> (Stern Pinball, 2004)</li>\n<li><i>Black Hole</i> (Gottlieb, 1981) (previously included in Pinball Hall of Fame: The Gottlieb Collection)</li>\n<li><i>Theatre of Magic</i> (Bally, 1995)</li></ul>\nAlmost every version of the game is a free download, and they each come with <i>Tales of the Arabian Nights</i> included for no extra cost, alongside its Pro upgrade, while the PS3/Vita/360 versions, which are paid releases instead, come with the aforementioned four tables; these are referred to as the \"core pack\" on other versions.<br>\nThe game also features a large amount of additional tables available for download, including tables that were already on previous <i>Pinball Hall of Fame</i> titles (such as <i>Black Knight</i>, <i>Medieval Madness</i>, <i>Big Shot</i> and <i>Central Park</i>) and other tables never seen on other games (such as <i>Attack from Mars</i>, <i>Cirqus Voltaire</i> and <i>Bride of Pin-Bot</i>), alongside some based on licensed properties (from tables like <i>Creature from the Black Lagoon</i> and <i>Elvira and the Party Monsters</i> to ones like <i>Twilight Zone</i> and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>), as well as Season Packs, which compile the tables from a respective \"season\" into one, although table availability varies from platform to platform. The method to purchase tables and season packs also varies depending on the platform, with most versions handling it inside the game, whereas on PlayStation and Xbox versions these are listed on and purchased/downloaded through their respective storefronts, although the Windows version also has the Season Packs listed on the Steam Store.<br>\nThere is support for achievements/trophies and online leaderboards, and the game includes a few extras, such as a little history on the games and the original sales flyers, plus in-depth instructions on every element of each table. It also has support for online play in the form of various online tournaments held by FarSight.",

Players can choose from a selection of traditional chess sets including Staunton, Checker and Williams and play with a choice of locations comprising of a museum, a stylish penthouse and a grand library. For players at a beginner's level the game teaches the basics through step-by-step tutorials. Chess skills can then be improved through tournaments with four consecutive games against different opponents of different skills levels. It also contains the official Elo rating system. Against computer players match replay data can be saved, but games cannot be saved mid-game to resume at a later time.\n\nNext to exhibitions matches and tournaments, it offers \"play by mail\" for asynchronous multiplayer games with up to 8 games simultaneously that can span hours, days or weeks. There is no standard local or online mode, only the asynchronous \"play by mail\" where moves are sent to another player over PSN through a message. That multiplayer mode is also limited to friends, it cannot be played through unknown other players. In the Challenge mode specific board setups are offered with the challenge to reach checkmate in just a few moves.",

      "description": "<i>Blacklight: Retribution</i> is the sequel to Blacklight: Tango Down. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person shooter focused solely on online multiplayer, but this time, it's available under a free-to-play business model. It is set in the same futuristic universe as the first game. Players can compete in various game modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Capture the Flag, Kill Confirmed etc. in private or public online matches.\n\nAlready featured in the first game, the Hyper Reality Visor (HRV) highlights enemies and other important things on your HUD and even let's you see through walls. But it is only usable for a limited amount of time and needs to recharge after use. Additionally, special grenades can disrupt the HRV's use. A level-based ranking system was also retained from the predecessor. Among the new features are Weapon Depots and Hardsuits: The former supply ammunition, heavy weapons and health at the cost of Combat Points (CP), which are earned during gameplay. The latter are heavily armed exoskeletons, which can be controlled by players. They are very hard to destroy using the standard arsenal, but the HRV can reveal weak points. \n\nWeapons and equipment are extensively customizable: There are several basic weapon models called receivers, like  pistol or assault rifle. By adding or changing specific components like barrel, optic sight, magazine or muzzle, players can create their own custom firearms. As an alternative, players may also buy pre-configured weapons (called Premades). Both weapon parts for customization and pre-made guns are obtained at the in-game marketplace, which offers body armor and other items as well. Two in-game currencies can be used: GP and ZEN. GP is slowly earned by playing, whereas ZEN can be bought with real money. So players wanting a certain item can either spend time playing until they gather enough GP, or they may buy ZEN and get the item immediately.",

      "description": "<i>The Unfinished Swan</i> is a game based around exploration. The story is told as a fairy tale. The player controls the character Monroe whose ends up in an orphanage after his mother died. She used to paint and he brought along one of her favourite paintings: The Unfinished Swan, displaying a swan that is missing its neck. One night he awakens to discover the swan has jumped out of the canvas and has disappeared through a small door. He follows it and is transported in a magical world that is entirely white. During the journey he chases after the swan and finds out he has entered the realm of a king. The story is furthered in-game through cut-scenes between chapters and in-game drawings like pages out of a children's storybook.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and Monroe is able to move around and jump. His only ability is to splatter the world with paint. The white garden where the game starts is entirely white, meaning there are no shadows or shades to give shape to the surroundings. That way launching paint is the only means to reveal surfaces. Objects or level elements do not disappear when they are not splattered, but it is as if Monroe is walking into a giant void. It can best be compared to the process of stone rubbing where the sense of distance and perspective of the entire world is only established through the paint. The game is split up into four large chapters with multiple levels for each. The initial technique of revelation is not maintained for the entire game as it makes navigation slow. Later levels are coloured entirely of largely in shades of grey and other types of paint are introduced, but they are not used simultaneously. Often there are brightly coloured objects that show where to go next or act as landmarks.\n\nAs Monroe explores castles and cities he often needs to solve environment-based puzzles, using ladders, jumping over gaps, and using paint to activate triggers that open gates of move platforms. In the second chapter with a giant city labyrinth vines are introduced. By launching paint Monroe can guide them to cover walls and objects, providing a means to climb and cross water that is deadly. The third chapter is set in set in a dark forest entirely in black. There, Monroe has to launch paint and hurl it a neon light sources to light up the environment. In the fourth chapter he enters the king's dreams and there yet another entirely different visual style is used.\n\nDuring the journey balloons are discovered. Collecting them is used to unlock options such as a balloon radar, the ability to stop time and launch several set of paints that, when time is activated again, all launch at once, unlock all levels and a gallery of concept art, and a fire hose that launches paint continuously. Two additional ones are only available when all balloons have been collected or the game has been completed respectively. The balloon radar displays a yellow balloon in the radar screen when one is nearby. The image becomes larger as the player approaches. On the level select screen the amount of collected/available balloons in each scene is shown. Optionally the game can be controlled through the Move peripheral.",

The game has multiple modes, including Team Deathmatch, Team Objective, Free-for-All, Last Team Standing, King of the Hill, Capture The Flag, and Duel Mode (1 vs 1).\n\nSince this is a melee focused game, you will be killing other knights and combatants with different melee weapons that range in size from short swords to gigantic axes and hammers. You can swing horizontally, overhead and in a stabbing motion. Since you can't hold a block indefinitely, you have to time your blocks right in order to stop incoming attacks. Everything is based on a stamina meter that will deplete when attacking and blocking. If you see someone with a shield blocking, you can give him a good kick to throw him off balance and open him up for attack. You can even trick your opponents into blocking by feigning your attacks. Once they block, their guard is down for a short period of time.\n\nChivalry is a very brutal game when it comes to dismemberment. A well-placed slash can take off heads and limbs. There is a single-player tutorial that shows you the ins and outs of combat as well as the different classes and how they work.",

      "description": "<i>ZombiU</i> is a first-person horror survival game based on the heritage of Zombi, the first game published by Ubisoft. The game is set in London, England, and the player controls a random survivor of a zombie apocalypse and starts in a metro station. Next to surviving, the protagonist is also after a cure to combat the outbreak, which was first predicted 400 years earlier as The Black Prophecy by John Dee, an astronomer and adviser to the queen. A secret society known as the 'Ravens of Dee' researched his predictions and worked towards finding a cure. The members hide in a bunker and one is chosen by the Raven leader Sondra to confront the zombies. The spiritual leader is called Prepper and assists the character through radio during missions by providing hints and overlooking the situation when the character manages to restore the power to the CCTV cameras. When those are online, Prepper can draw maps of the surroundings that are displayed on the GamePad. Meanwhile, Dr. Knight, one of the Queen's doctors, also searches for the cure as a panacea under Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe protagonist explores different locations, needs to take out zombies, and collects items and weapons. True to the spirit of survival horror, it features a form of permadeath. If the character becomes killed or infected, which is possible with a single bite, he slowly turns into a zombie and if no medicine to combat it is found, another character from the bunker is sent out to continue the mission, but without the gathered items or weapons. In the hardcore Survival mode the consequences are fiercer as the entire campaign needs to be restarted with no option to revert back to an earlier point. Basic items when starting are a flashlight, a gun, some ammo and a cricket bat. Ammo is scarce and needs to be spent wisely. In most situations riskier melee weapons are used to save the firearms for the most difficult encounters. Even then, only head shots are effective. It is however possible to track down the former protagonist and kill it to reclaim the inventory. Next to the basic items there are also medicine, grenades, molotov cocktails and wooden planks to barricade doors. Barricading doors and hacking combinations locks is done in context-sensitive situations through the GamePad's touchscreen. In other situations it displays the mini-map (when available), and it is used as a sniper scope or to manage the inventory. Additional items can be stored in the home base. The device's gyroscope is used to scan the environment by holding the left trigger. The GamePad is held up towards the TV and acts as a scanner to view the surroundings, even through walls. At those moment the game turns to a fixed third-person view where the character remains vulnerable. Discovered items in unexplored rooms through scans are stored on the mini-map to help locate them.\n\nAttacking requires a careful approach. When fighting with the bat for instance, holding the left trigger is used to block, and to attack the right trigger needs to be held. Once released, the bat is swung. If the right one is held too long, the character becomes tired with the raised arm and lowers it again. As the movement is slow, it requires precise timing during fights and only a small amount of zombies can be attacked that way at once. The right trigger is also used to shake off zombies. They generally leave the character alone when no sound is made or when he has not been spotted. Therefore most situations require the isolation of zombies from larger groups. When the Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters can appear as zombies in the game, and clues or hint tagged on walls can be seen by other players in their games.\n\nMultiplayer is available for two players and only offline. One player uses the GamePad and is King Boris, king of the zombies. The environment is shown using a top-down view of the entire level and the king can put zombies in the game while the other player uses a standard controller (Wii Remote with Nunchuk or Pro Controller) to complete the levels. The asymmetric multiplayer is organized around three game modes and five maps, but with the same type of gameplay, including elements of capture-the-flag and domination game types.\n\nThe later released ports for other platforms work without the above described inclusion of the Wii U GamePad. All special gimmicks like the scan function are either triggered with a button press or are otherwise integrated into the UI, e.g. the map is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Online capabilities and multiplayer are completely gone, ",

      "description": "<i>PlanetSide 2</i> is a free-to-play massively multiplayer online first-person shooter that delivers combat on a large scale with up to 2,000 players in a single conflict. It is a re-imagening of the original PlanetSide game. Battles take place with air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of troops. Whether in open fields, tightly packed urban centers or enormous structures, planning, teamwork and communication are essential. The game features continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space. Landmass has intrinsic value as the meta game is about territorial control of a continent split up into different sectors.\n\nThe game has a day-and-night cycle that influences the warfare, and soldiers can sprint, use iron sight and access regenerating shields. By gaining experience (battle rank) additional skills can be unlocked through certification points. There are three factions (Terran Republic, New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty) with classes such as Light Assault, Heavy Assault, Medic, Engineer, Infiltrator and Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit. Players can switch classes and there is an overall skill progression, not tied to a specific class.\n\nThe premium part of the game allows player to purchase convenience items and cosmetic changes with real cash. Optionally a subscription can be purchased for additional advantages.",

      "description": "<i>Gone Home</i> is a story-driven adventure game played from a first-person perspective. It focuses on exploration and is set entirely in a single house. The protagonist is Kaitlin Greenbriar, a 20-year-old woman who returns to her parents home in the USA on 7th June 1995 after a long trip in Europe. When she arrives the house is entirely deserted with no trace of her father, mother or sister Samantha. Sam however has left a note on the door that she is gone and urging her sister not to come look for her.\n\nThe game then offers the player the ability to freely explore the rooms of the house in any order or direction. Clues are pieced together by examining items in the environment: notes, letters, bills, photographs etc. These are however not presented as puzzles, but are scattered among typical items found in a house. The core gameplay revolves around browsing through items of which most serve no direct purpose. Drawers can be opened, lights can be turned on, you can look inside a dishwasher, browse books in a library, read flyers ... Most items are typical for specific rooms, such as different types of foods in a refrigerator, but also a lot of random items such as buttons, markers, pieces of papers and more, as they are expected to be found in a typical family home. Almost every item in the environment can be examined even if there is no direct purpose. Items can be picked up and rotated freely in any direction to get a better look. Every item can be dragged around and tossed at a different location, or sometimes used in the environment such as putting a tape in a recorder to listen to music. This does not serve as a mechanism to solve puzzles however, you are rather encouraged to find as many clues as possible and then piece together the story and the events by yourself. The amount of information discovered only depends on the player's investigation and is not enforced by the game. Exploration is non-linear, but there are a few triggers through keys to locked sections to slightly guide the player.\n\nMovement is done through separate keys with the mouse to look around. Items that can be interacted with are highlighted. The second mouse button is used to zoom in. There is a basic inventory system for the few sections where Kaitlin keeps an item with her, but not as a puzzle mechanism. Certain key items trigger an audio diary of Kaitlin's sister Sam. These are afterwards stored in a separate menu for further review. There is also a map for the different rooms and floors in the house, and it is expanded when new locations are discovered. The house is largely dark and deserted, so often light sources need to be turned on to get a better look.",

      "description": "<i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> takes place five years after Grand Theft Auto IV and is now set in Los Santos. It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.\n\nMichael, whilst hiding in the witness protection program as a result of a botched robbery nine years earlier, encounters Franklin who, in his capacity as a repo man, is sent to get a car from Michael's son Jimmy. Michael however realises Franklin is being set up, so tells Franklin to crash his sons car into the dealership who sent him. After that, they become friends. One day, Michael discovers his wife in bed with another man, and with Franklin's help, chases him to a mansion, which they promptly burn to the ground. The mansion, unfortunately, belongs to Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, who demands they compensate him for what they did. They successfully rob a jewelry store, and one of Michael's old partners Trevor hears of this, and asks to team up with the other two, who agree. From here their lives begin to spiral out of control.\n\nThe game's multiplayer component is called <i>GTA Online</i>. It is set two months before the start of the single-player story. It allows up to 16 players (PS3 / Xbox 360) or 30 players (Xbox One / PS4 / PC) to travel around a world identical to the single-player world to complete story-driven activities, both competitive and co-operative.\n\nThe later released PS4, Xbox One and PC versions have various enhancements and additional features. Technical upgrades include an increased draw distance and support for higher resolutions. New content includes new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects. The Dodo is a classic <i>GTA</i> seaplane, there are stock car races with additional liveries, a new Imponte Duke O'Death vehicle, the Marshall Monster Truck, and the Xero Blimp. There are new shooting challenges and new weapons such as the rail gun and hatchet. New wildlife photo challenges let players unlock the Kraken submarine. A new murder mystery can be solved to unlock film noir game filters. Monkey Mosaics are a new collectible to unlock monkey outfits and Monkey Blista. There are also 100 additional songs divided over the 17 existing radio stations. The most distinct new feature is a full first-person view for the entire game, allowing the player to shoot, walk and drive from that perspective. This comes with entirely new animations for the view, showing the hands when entering cars or in melee fights, and vehicles have fully functional interiors, HUDs and interfaces.",

      "description": "<i>Shadow Fall</i> is set 30 years in the future after the events of Killzone 3.  Helghast refugees who survived the catastrophic event known as \"the Terracide\" have been allowed by the ISA to live with them in a new futuristic city on the planet Vekta.  The two enemies are now separated by a large heavily guarded structure known as the Wall.  Taking control of ISA Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellan, your job to maintain peace between the two rival factions becomes tense as undercover operations to put an end to the war arise.  Armed with an immense hatred toward the Helghast, Kellan will stop at nothing to protect his planet and put an end to the threat, even willing to sacrifice anything to do so.\n\nGameplay in <i>Shadow Fall</i> is fairly similar to previous installments, though now with more improvements.  The game is much more open-ended allowing for multiple ways to reach your target and complete objectives.  The player is accompanied by a companion drone called the OWL which can help you in many different ways including deploying a zip-line or stunning the enemy. Using futuristic weapons and gear allows for new stealth gameplay.  The online multiplayer mode allows for up to 24-players to battle at once on any of the games default 10 maps. The level system is now challenge-based where completing any of the games many challenges will upgrade your rank.  Warzone returns as an online game mode along with Team Deathmatch and Beacon Retrieval (Capture the Flag). A new feature allows for the user to create Warzones with their own specific rules and share them with the community to download and play.",

As with previous <i>Call of Duty</i> games, the player takes control of a number of characters from different points of view from the conflict, but the story is told largely from the point of view of a US 'Ghost' team, a special forces team specialising in the clandestine and the covert as they track down a former <i>Ghost</i> that has been captured and brainwashed by the Federation.\n\nAs with all titles in the series <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i> has a large multiplayer portion. Standard CoD modes such as free for all and Team deathmatch make an appearance, along with Ground War, which rotates between Domination and Team Deathmatch and Blitz, which is similar to capture the flag, but instead of having flags, players must get to portals located at the enemy spawn point in order to score.",

      "description": "<i>Shadow Warrior</i> is a reboot of the 1997 first-person shooter Shadow Warrior. The player controls the ninja mercenary Lo Wang who is hired by Zilla Enterprise to buy the katana Nobitsura Kage for 2 million dollars. When the deal goes awry Wang is captured. After he manages to escape he bonds with the spirit Hoji who also holds an interest in the katana. The game is then divided into different chapters where Wang chases after the katana. The game uses an Asian setting in a modern day environment.\n\nWang's main weapon is his katana used for close melee combat. It slices quickly controlled through mouse movement and there are different types of (charged) strikes and skills to provide variation. The other weapons offer ranged attacks: a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, a crossbow, a rocket launcher, the excalibat from Rise of the Triad etc. When using the katana shuriken can be thrown quickly. Upgrades are provided in three categories (Weapons, Skills and Powers) each with their own currency (money, karma and KI crystals respectively) and with different tiers. Most skills are performed through key combinations combined with the mouse. They offer new ways to attack, but can also used to heal Wang. Levels are generally linear, but there are a few alternative routes and many secrets. Boss fights often take place in large arenas.\n\nNext to the main campaign mode with different difficulty levels two additional modes become available after completing the game. In Ex mode the game is played from the beginning once more but with all the upgrades from the previous run. In Heroic mode there are no automatic saves or checkpoints; saving is only done between missions. A later update added a fourth mode called Survival where Wang fights waves of enemies on three maps.",

      "description": "<i>Battlefield 4</i> is a military first-person shooter set in the near future and basically a direct continuation of Battlefield 3. Like all games in the series, the focus is on its multiplayer mode in which player either take the role of an assault (front soldiers with medic abilities), recon (snipers), support (front soldiers who can give out ammo) or engineers (explosives experts). All classes have special abilities and gadgets which can be unlocked over time. In a variety of mostly team-based playing variants - most importantly conquest in which certain points on the maps have to be held by the own team and the faster rush mode with an defending team and an attacking team which has to destroy certain points - players face each other on usually big maps with a variety of vehicles to use. \n\nOf course this instalments features various small and big differences to its predecessors. The most important are the interactive \"Levolution\" elements which emphasize the destroyable areas; one of the unique selling points of the Frostbite engine: each map has one level element which significantly changes how the level looks and plays when destroyed. <i>Battlefield 4</i> also brings back two elements from previous instalments: naval warfare and the commander mode. The commander is an additional player who sees the level from an overhead map, gives orders to the team members and can assign missile strikes. In contrast to Battlefield 2, the commander is not an actual player character on the battlefield and therefore can't be killed. New playing modes are Defuse (both teams have to detonate a bomb in a target zone, each player has only one \"life\" per round) and Obliteration (there spawns only one bomb pack on the map which has to be used to detonate three points on the map).\n\nLike the predecessor, <i>Battlefield 4</i> features a singleplayer campaign. A Chinese general overthrows the government, starts a war with the whole world (but is allied with Russia) and the USA has to save the day. The player takes the role of a faceless soldier named Recker, as commander of a small troop he can assign basic orders, who has to survive several missions of the usual Call of Duty variety: linear levels with a lot of boom and hundreds of enemies to shoot. In comparison to <i>Battlefield 3</i>, some levels are a bit more and in some cases the player drives a vehicle. Of course there are also the usual stealth and torture sequences. There is no co-op mode anymore.\n\nThe Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions only allow 24 instead of 64 players at a time and have therefore smaller multiplayer maps.",

You play as Miles Upshur, a freelance journalist who breaks into a long-abandoned, but recently re-opened mental asylum. Inside he finds dead bodies, mental patients and a hint of some terrible experiment gone wrong.\n\nAs Miles wanders though the asylum he encounters various mental patients, both passive and aggressive. Stealth approach is advised, since if aggressive patients spot him they will try to hunt him down searching the area where they last saw him. Miles has no means to protect himself, but he can effectively hide behind and under the furniture, climb ledges and slide in narrow gaps. The only tool he has is a video-camera with night vision function that allows him to navigate dark places. Night vision consumes batteries which Miles must collect throughout the asylum.\n\nAt certain scripted moments the stealthy pace of the game changes and Miles finds himself hunted by the patients in runaway sequences reminding of the escape from the hotel in Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.

      "description": "<i>Thief</i> is a reboot of the <i>Thief</i> series and throws away most of the lore - there are no Pagans, no Hammers and no Watchers. The game starts when Garrett, a master thief, is on a job with his former apprentice Erin. They run into a mysterious ritual from a faction loosely reminiscent on the Mechanists, and due to unfortunate happenings Erin falls right into the middle of it. Garrett blacks out for a year and awakens in the city which changed to a fascist regime in the meantime. Now Garrett has to use his thieving skills in order to find out what is going on (the common people are affected by a strange disease) and eventually stop the usual conspiracy.\n\nThe basic structure is similar to Deadly Shadows: There is a semi-open city hub structured into various districts. Just like in the predecessor, those are divided in loading screens and gradually open up over the course of the game. These can be freely explored until starting a self-contained mission at the designated point. Here lies the main difference to the previous <i>Thief</i> games: instead of sandbox levels, the design is completely modular and can be compared to the Clocktower level in <i>Deadly Shadows</i>. The set-pieces may be relatively open in itself and offer various ways to deal with obstacles or reach the next point of interest, but in the end they result in a choke-point of no return leading to the next area. Movement is also restricted because jumping is only contextual. Rope arrows make their return, but can only be used at a few designated spots. Except for a few minor climbing sequences, the whole game is in first-person.\n\nGarrett can take on guards in direct combat, the system is based on dodging attacks with a designated button and placing blackjack hits at the right moments, but since he is no fighter he usually has no change against multiple enemies. So his main weapon of choice is stealth. It is based on shadows - the light gem in the interface shows how visible Garrett is - and while breaking sight also plays its role, there is no dedicated cover mechanic like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. However, Garrett can grab onto corners and peek out to avoid running in front of a guard. This means the majority of the time is spent with observing guard patrols, picking a good time to move behind a guard, performing a blackjack takedown and drag the body into darkness before someone sees it. Like in <i>Human Revolution</i>, the takedown is a context based button press instead of a free swing. \n\nIn contrast to the previous <i>Thief</i> games there is no loot requirement to beat a mission, but of course there is still plenty of stuff to steal which is directly converted into gold. While the majority of small loot items is just lying around or found by opening drawers, there are also unique items which bring extra money. These are usually hidden and require the usage of a new mechanic: Garrett grabs a painting or book shelf and slowly moves his hand until he feels a hidden switch. By pressing a button, it may open up a secret passage, unveil a safe or disable traps. The lockpicking minigame works similar and requires to find the sweet spot by moving the lockpick around. Safes require the combination which has to manually puzzled out by searching the environment for clues and carefully reading near documents.\n\nBetween missions, Garrett can also find much loot in the city by just moving around and keeping his eyes open. However, the most lucrative is to take optional side missions. Here Garrett has to retrieve a certain object - usually it is just a quick burglary within the city, but sometimes they are real self-contained missions. Of course there is a useful usage for money: visiting a shop and stock up on equipment. The obvious choices are depleting resources like Garrett's trademark arrows which can be used for many tasks, e.g. regular arrows for distracting guards or water arrows to extinguish light sources, food items to heal, or smoke bombs. However, there are also various one-time purchases which reward new equipment to interact with the environment, e.g. a razor to cut out valuable painting or a wrench to open up ventilation shafts, or tool upgrades, e.g. a bigger arrow capacity or more sensitive lockpicks. Also available are items which reward passive bonuses. Additionally Garrett has two magical abilities to his disposal: The swoop move works similar to blink in Dishonored and allows to quickly move forward. Focus (similar to instinct in Hitman: Absolution) slows down time and has several useful perks, e.g. faster lockpicking, easier combat or showing all loot in the area. Those perks have to be unlocked with focus points which are also bought with money.\n\nOne of the game's special features are the difficulty modes. While there are the usual three standard types - the highest does not allow for kills or civilian knockouts - the player can also add several other difficulty options, e.g. disabling focus, more expensive resources, slower movement, no kills or knockouts, no quicksave or permadeath. Because those reward bonus points for bragging rights, the difficulty can only be changed when starting a new game. On the other hand there are also several other interface related options which can be disabled at any time, e.g. loot glow, prompts when approaching an interactive item, enemy alert indicators, objective markers, mini map or ammo counter. \n\nBesides the main campaign, there is also a challenge mode. This mode re-uses some of the game's mission areas and adds special objectives. The modes are Chain & Gain (there is a timer running out which can only be expanded by collecting loot), Chain & Gain Limited (Chain & Gain with an overall time limit) and Special Loot Hunt (finding as much special loot within a time limit by using the \"hot and cold\" indicators). The goal is a leaderboards high-score.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version uses the DualShock 4 gamepad's light bar to emphasize the effect of being in the shadow (with a dimmed dark blue) or exposed to the light (with a bright white).",

      "description": "<i>Tower of Guns</i> is a first-person shooter that borrows from <i>roguelike</i> games, with randomized environments, enemies, items, perks and power-ups for each session. It also has permadeath. A gameplay session offers different arena-like rooms where a large amount of enemies need to be destroyed. A single door leads to a new room and after a large opponent an elevator is used to move to a new part of the tower.\n\nAt the start of the game the player chooses a weapon and a perk. There are ten weapons and eleven perks in total. To unlock all of them certain conditions need to be met. Each weapon has a different effectiveness complemented with a perk such as faster character speed, more armor, a triple jump, no falling damage, permanent loot, no self damage etc. Destroyed enemies leave behind red orbs that restore health, coins and blue items that fill up a weapon experience meter. Each time a new weapon level is reached (up to five), the main gun becomes more powerful. When the character gets hurt not only health is lost, but the weapon level can be lowered as well. Other random gameplay elements are badges that permanently alter characteristics similar to the starting perks, such as faster speed, more chance for critical strikes, gun modifications or additional double jumps (up to such a large amount it is almost like flying). There are also items of which only one can be carried. These offer additional bonuses, special attacks or a giant jump. Coins can be used at vending machines to unlock an item or badge on display.\n\nLevels and enemies often have an industrial look and the game has a humorous touch visible in the text during the game, visual elements, giant bouncing projectiles and extreme gun modifications such as a rocket launcher that acts as a shotgun. The gameplay is twitch based and requires constant movement, dodging and quick reflexes. It also supports air control for character movement, bunny hopping, circle strafing, gaining movement speed through slopes, jelly-like cubes that provide boost, and double jumps that can be performed multiple times in succession. Next to the variation in enemy and level design, the different rooms contain secrets on hard to reach places, usually by walking through walls or dropping down floors. When stuck in a part of the level without the ability to jump out of it, a key can be held to respawn at the start of the room.",

      "description": "<i>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth. Part of the long-running <i>Metal Gear</i> franchise, it is a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and it takes place after Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker as a part of a sub-series or prequels in the main franchise set long before Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.\n\nThe most important change for this title is the shift to an open world design with a real-time day and night cycle doing away with the linear mission approach of previous games. The protagonist is Big Boss (Snake) and the game is set in 1975 after the events of <i>Peace Walker</i>. Snake works with Militaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res and needs to infiltrate an American black site Camp Omega on Cuba where Cipher agent Paz and child soldier Chico, two returning characters from <i>Peace Walker</i>, are held. This is the only location in the game and it consists of a large base with different sections, courtyards, outhouses and concrete tunnels, surrounded by rocks and foliage offering many entry points. The game offers the single objective to free them and the player determines the approach. To add to this freedom, helpful tools from previous titles, such as the Soliton radar map with the waypoints, have been removed. Snake can however mark enemies through his binoculars to keep track of movement. The mini-map has been replaced with a map accessed through a handheld iDroid device, but using it does not pause the game. The iDroid functions can also be accessed through an Adroid or iOS companion app on a real mobile device in conjunction with the game. It can be used to set waypoints, check mission information and listen to audio files. There is no longer a camouflage system. Instead, cues need to be taken from the opportunities in the surroundings and the time of day, with light and shadow, also play a role. Although the focus is on stealth, the sandbox design also offers a more direct approach with guns and explosives. A flare can be used to call in a helicopter, for support or extraction, and different types of vehicles such as tanks, jeeps and trucks can be stolen and driven.\n\nWith a stealth approach enemies can be knocked out or taken down with a knife. It is also possible to take them into a chokehold and threaten them for information. When using a pure third-action shooter approach (with the ability to shift to first-person) many means can be found inside the camp, including turrets and guns stolen from the base or taken from soldiers. Enemies have a line of sight and Snake can stay hidden through crouching. Once detected, enemies become suspicious with an indicator that changes its colour based on their alertness. When Snake is observed directly or body is discovered, a different alert mode is triggered without an indicator. In that state Snake needs to track their radio signals where they pass on his movement and wait until they calm down again. When spotted directly, a slowdown feature is activated where there is a short time-frame to lock on an enemy and shoot him or take him out through other means.\n\nNext to the main mission Ground Zeroes, four additional side missions can be unlocked in the same location but set before the main mission. A fifth one becomes available after collecting all XOF patches and it is different one based on the system (PS/Xbox).",

The graphics are deliberately crude and all persons are presented like figures from a board game.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, this is an adventure game: the player solves puzzles by using items with other items (or simply by finding the correct item to activate). There are also various mandatory and optional mini games like playing mini golf, participating in a boat race, Galaga or a first-person shooter sequence with a wedding theme. However, the main draw of the game is its non-sequential humour. When exploring the levels, there are many references to discover and many optional items to activate which usually has a humorous consequence.",

      "description": "<i>Daylight</i> is a first-person survival horror game where the player takes on the role of Sarah who wakes up with no recollection of previous events in an abandoned hospital and an adjacent prison. Her goal is to escape and find out what has happened. A voice-over often explains parts of what's happened when a key item has been picked up. The most important tool in the game is her cellphone. It provides light in the darkness and can render a map of the environments. Later on the game additional light resources can be picked up such as up to four glow sticks or flares. She can examine objects in the surroundings and needs to solve small environment puzzles to open up new paths to progress in the complex. Next to providing light, flares act as the only weapon in the game as they can be used to scare off ghouls with the only other option to run away. The phone turns to static when the ghoul is nearby.\n\nSarah's investigation has an immediate impact on the threat of enemies. To progress, she needs to collect six remnants in a certain area. These are clues such as notes and records. These can be tracked through markings that become visible when lighted with glow sticks. With each collected part the chance of threats is heightened as picking one up makes a threat meter fill up. When all remnants are collected, they need to be brought to a glowing room where they can be turned into a sigil, an item that needs to be carried to the seal of shadows (a locked door) that leads to a new section. During that part, Sarah can holds no torches or flares, so she needs to dash through the darkness with no means of defense. In addition, a single game session is limited to two hours so there is additional pressure to move swiftly. Replaying the game is encouraged through procedural generation elements, for instance randomizing the location of the parts and the two key rooms for each session as well as parts of the overall room lay-out. The game also employs a wide variety of startling audio and moving object scares to add to the horror theme.",

      "description": "<i>Whistleblower</i> is DLC for Outlast and acts as a prologue set just before the events of the original game as well as an epilogue. After the introduction the story soon runs parallel with the main game. The player takes on the role of software engineer Waylon Park, the man who tips off Miles Upshur, the protagonist of the main game, about the events in the Mount Massive Asylum. Park works at the asylum for Murkoff Corporation working directly with the Morphogenic Engine for the experimental treatment of patients and he witnesses the torture that Billy Hope endures. After sending an e-mail to Upshur informing him, he is caught by his employed Jeremy Blaire and forced to endure the Morphogenic Engine himself for two hours as a test. However, as the supernatural entity Walriders escapes and causes mayhem at the institution, Park manages to escape. His goal is to escape the facility and inform the authorities.\n\nThe game reuses some assets of the original game's environment, but the journey is in a reversed order. Park starts in the underground laboratories and needs to make his way up to the asylum. Next to the existing cast, the game introduces the new characters Jeremy Blaire (Park's employer) and the patients Eddie Gluskin and Frank Antonio Manera. The gameplay is identical, with a focus on stealth and navigating the environment to avoid encounters. The horror elements with gruesome scenes remain present and Park too uses a camcorder that provides night vision. Just like the original game he is powerless against ghouls and needs to flee when spotted. There are generally less encounters with patients compared to the original game. Various conversations and notes provide background to the story.",

      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein: The New Order</i> marks the return of one of the oldest first-person shooter franchises, Wolfenstein 3D, and once again puts player in the role of Polish-American soldier William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz. The game begins in 1946 with Blazkowicz chasing down his arch-enemy General Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse knowing that if he can kill Deathshead the Nazi war machine will be crippled. His plans backfire however and Blazkowicz is mortally wounded and put into a partial coma.  He is rescued by a Polish fishing vessel and taken to an asylum in Poland where 14 years pass as he is cared for by a nurse named Anya. When he finally awakens and saves Anya from the Nazi purge of the asylum, he soon learns that the war has ended and the Nazis won, thus placing the entire world under their rule. Deathshead was instrumental to this victory as he designed vicious bio-mechanical beasts and massive robots to gain superiority in the battlefield while also bombarding the United States with atomic bombs until their eventual surrender. Blazkowicz arms up once again and sets out to reignite the flames of rebellion by freeing his friends from the Kreisau Circle and toppling the Nazi regime!\n\nAs with previous entries in the series the game is a fast-paced and violent first-person shooter with some minor stealth and exploration elements. Players can hold several weapons at a time and said weapons can even be dual wielded. The weapons range from traditional weapons such as knives, pistols, and shotguns but later in game there is more exotic gear such as electricity spewing grenades, lasers, bladed weapons etc. You are also given a useful tool called the Laser Cutter, which allows you to cut through chains, fences, etc. to access alternate paths and secret items and areas.\n\nPlayers fight plenty of Nazi soldiers of varying strength, some wearing power armour and some are even bio-mechanical and blend flesh with technology. There are also bio-mechanical German Shepherds that act as guard dogs and can sneak up on the player to attempt to tear out his throat. In addition there are bigger fully robotic dogs that are extremely fast, lithe, and dangerous. Players have the option of taking a stealthy route and killing enemies silently with silenced weapons and knives that can be used for brutal backstabbing takedowns or can be thrown at enemies in the distance. \n\nAt times you will be notified of a Nazi officer in the area. Hunting him down and killing him quietly will reveal areas on the player's map. The game features a perk tree, which will level up based on certain challenges in the game such as killing 10 enemies silently with throwing knives to earn extra knife slots or killing several enemies while your health is overcharged (above 100%) to gain a perk where killing enemies grants small health boosts. These perks come in different categories (assault, demolition, stealth and tactical) and are based around the player's chosen play style.  \n\nAlso in line with previous games in the series, there are secrets to be collected. These include items that can give you a full map of the area, notes and letters that provide backstory, Enigma Codes which unlock special game modes, and Nazi gold and treasure.",

      "description": "<i>Warface</i> is an free-to-play multiplayer shooter which focuses on fast action on relatively small maps. The game is set in a fictional world in which corporations have taken control and elite soldiers fight against each other. In each match, the player takes one of four classes: Rifleman (offensive firepower and the support ability to give out ammo packs), Engineer (specialised in explosives and can repair armor), Medic (carries a shotgun and can heal respectively resurrect fallen teammates) and Sniper (long-range combat). The game offers two playing modes: versus (up to 16 players) and co-op (up to four players). In versus, the possible variants are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Plant the Bomb (the attacking team needs to plant bombs on certain spots while the other team needs to prevent it), Destruction (King of the Hill) and Storm (the attacking team tries to take three command post from the defending team). The co-op missions are linear maps in which players shoot a lot of enemies until they reach the end.\n\nAn important part plays the inventory which stores all weapons and gear bought in the in-game shop and from which the player chooses the weapon loadout for the next match. The game has three currencies: dollars are earned in matches, crowns earned in co-op missions and \"kredits\" bought via micro-transaction. While the regular gear can be purchased with both dollars and kredits, they are either only rented for a few days or are prone to deterioration and need to be regularly repaired with more money. Another restriction is that those items need to be unlocked through matches before they can be purchased. Experience is earned by playing matches and, depending on the game mode, is also rewarded for support actions and not only kills. Some items can only be purchased with kredits (a boost for earned experience/money, instant co-op resurrections and random item collections) or crowns (the most powerful gear).",

To find her the child needs to travel to locations from his memory, aided by a talking teddy bear. At several locations the child encounters a horrifying figure that will try to catch him. The child has no means to protect himself, he can only hide and try to outsmart the creature. The game holds an underlying social message not unlike the one found in Papo & Yo.  \n\nIn November 2014 a new Chapter - Prologue - was added for free. The prologue explains some events that happened before the main game, but is intended for players who have already completed the main story. The prologue is played in a cabin in the woods during snowfall, when the child awakens at night because someone has forgot to shut the window, and he's cold and scared.",

      "description": "<i>Sniper Elite III</i> is the third main game in the tactical shooter series based around a sniper. Karl Fairburne, an Office of Strategic Services officer, is once against the protagonist, but this title is set before the events of the previous game Sniper Elite V2. He is part of the North Africa campaign sent behind enemy lines during World War II to target a secret weapons programme of the Nazi troops. The bright and colourful African environments are very different from the dark Berlin ruins in the previous game.\n\nThe basic gameplay is similar. Fairburne needs to complete objectives in eight extensive levels using melee weapons, pistols, (sub)machine guns, his sniper rifle, booby traps, land mines and explosives. Direct action is possible, but not encouraged to complete levels entirely. The typical X-ray kill cam impact of sniper bullets is still present and it has been expanded to cover vehicles that can be taken apart piece by piece until they explode. The biggest difference in design is the amount of freedom. The game moves away from narrow corridors to a nonlinear approach in a more open environment with different options to progress. Exploration is encouraged to discover secondary objectives. Because of the environment there are more elements such as foliage that can be used to remain hidden. During missions Fairburne gains experience for completing objectives, the circumstances of shots and collecting secrets. Experience is used to customize the character, acquire better weapons and other improvements. It is gained through all available game modes. A loadout can be defined and additional weapons are picked up from defeated enemies.\n\nThe game's stealth system has been reworked. There is now an eye icon that shows whether the enemy can detect Fairburne. A circle meter over the heads of enemies shows their alertness. There are various statutes, for instance when they have heard a shot or discovered a body, but are unsure about the exact location of Fairburne. A noise meter shows when a silent shot is possible through sound masking, for instance due to a passing plane. The game discourages staying in the same position for too long. After a number of shots enemies will know the exact location. A ghost image then appears to show an approximate position and the player then has a limited amount of time to move to a new spot. The game's difficulty level can be altered to make sniping harder, removing types of assistance and making other elements more important, such as gravity, breathing, heart beat, wind and ballistics.\n\nRegular multiplayer games are supported as deathmatch and team deathmatch. It also has Distant King (free-for-all or in teams) where players are awarded for the cumulative distance of shots instead of the number of kills. The No Cross mode puts players each on a side of the map to focus more on sniping instead of regular combat. The cooperative Overwatch mode returns where a sniper and a spotter work together in two missions. They can also work together in a Survival mode and the entire campaign can be played cooperatively. Players earn medals and ribbons in multiplayer games.",

Just like the original game, the player is a surgeon who operates on patient Bob with gameplay heavily based on physics and a humorous undertone. This version carries over the additions introduced in the mobile device version of the game, such as the eye and teeth operations, as well as the new environment where you operate on a rolling trolley through the hospital corridors. Next to overall fixes, the game has an updated visual style. The game keeps track of the statistics of the last nine surgeries and introduces new achievements. There are over twenty operations and five locations in total.\n\nOn the PS4, the motion control of the controller is used to rotate the hand. Exclusive to the PS4 version is a local cooperative mode. Featuring a drop in / drop out system, a second hand appears and the two players can work together or hinder each other.",

      "description": "<i>The Walking Dead Pinball</i> is a pinball game/table with the engine of <i>Pinball FX2</i> and based on The Walking Dead, the first season of Telltale's adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic book series. The field of play is made up out of various locations from the series (including the St. John\u2019s Dairy Farm, Travelier Motel, Bell Tower, Train & Level Crossing, RV and more) with no visually defined boundaries of where the table ends. The different missions in the game are inspired by the five episodes including split-decision choices that determine life and death for characters, provide solutions to problems, and help acquire tools, fuel or vehicles. Zombies are also part of the missions and they often need to be taken out or block off certain routes. There are various mini-games such as a sniper mission or a defense mission where you need to prevent zombies from getting too close. Next to the locations, the game also uses the music and various voice clips from the episodes. The scenery can change from day to night, making it dark and illuminating certain sections, as was previously done in the <i>Marvel Pinball: Blade</i> table. Lee and Clementine appear as 3D characters in the table.\n\nThe game is standalone for iOS and Android (Amazon version). The PC, Xbox, Wii U, and PlayStation versions require Pinball FX2 or Zen Pinball 2 (available for free) and then offer this table as DLC. For iOS it can also be bought as DLC for Zen Pinball and for Android as DLC for Zen Pinball HD (Google Play release).",

      "description": "<i>Zen Pinball 2</i> is the sequel to Zen Pinball, the equivalent of the <i>Pinball FX</i> games on Xbox and PC. The features and the visual style are similar to Pinball FX2. As with most games in the series it is free to play where tables are bought as DLC. For the PS3 and PS Vita this is done as a cross buy. For the later released PS4 version as well, but a table purchase is imported through the main menu. Cross buy does not apply to the PS4 version however, so to get them across all available PlayStation systems with a single purchase they need to be bought for the PS3 or the PS Vita.\n\nThe PS4, Macintosh, iOS and Android versions contain the full and unrestricted Sorcerer's Lair table for free. The full catalog of tables depends on the platform, though new tables are generally released for all available platforms. All tables can be played for free for a few minutes. The game has different viewpoints, both analog and digital ball launches based on the type of table, mini-games, 3D animations, leaderboards, tournaments and personal statistics. Offline multiplayer, in split-screen (consoles only) or taking turns, is available for two to four players respectively.\n\nFor iOS it is released as <i>Zen Pinball</i> as a follow-up free hub version to previous stand-alone table releases such as Zen Pinball: Rollercoaster and Zen Pinball: Inferno. For iOS as well as Android some table releases are still standalone next to the hub DLC version.",

It is set in the year 2100 when mankind first sets foot on the planet Mars. The player acts as the commander in charge of the mission. There are various tasks to complete, such as docking the space ship, scanning for distant galaxies with a satellite, calibrating a solar collector, collecting samples with a magnetic crane, using a spider to research Martian symbols, stabilizing gravity, refueling, deactivating Mars' defense systems and unlocking the secrets of a pyramid as the end game. Multiball is set in zero gravity. There is also a mission when the ship can freeze and the ball turns white.\n\nThere are two regular flippers at the bottom and an additional one near the mid right to reach a lane. The outer parts of the fields have lanes and they also lead to the spinners. In the centre there are various holes. The level has many 3D animations such as the space ship docking on the table and a spider hopping on the bottom of the table to activate kickback.",

The goal of the game is to win the heart of one of the possible romantic avian partners, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's action. The gameplay is typical for the visual novel genre, mostly consisting of dialogue with the player occasionally needing to choose an action or a dialogue answer. ",

      "description": "<i>Epic Quest</i> is a DLC pinball table for Pinball FX2 (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows), Zen Pinball 2 (PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U), and Zen Pinball (HD) (iOS and Android). The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. The table is designed around the adventures of knight Max, an enthusiastic, comical hero who goes on quests to defeat monsters. Max is always present as a 3D character in the top left part of the table. There is a quirky tone, with backgrounds on the side that change as in a theatre, Max' comments and him riding a wooden horse.\n\nThe table has a basic set of flippers at the bottom of the screen, a double outlane on the right and a triple on the left. There's another flipper near the top left of the table as the only means to reach a separate area. The game incorporates some RPG elements. By defeating monsters and completing quests Max earns experience (a red bar at the bottom of the table) and he can level up. He earns items and can buy new ones (by trading in the old ones) through a loot hole. These items alter his statistics, providing more damage, armor or adding elements elements to attack or defense. There are also different sets of epic items in a different colour. Experience and items are kept across game sessions, allowing the player to build the character. The monsters' level always matches the one of Max.\n\nThe game contains three locations with twelve monsters each unlocked gradually. Once a fight is started, health for both sides is shown at the bottom of the table. Time counts down from ten for each enemy hit and the player can perform various actions. The sword ramp is used to attack and shield to parry or counter attack (when followed up with the sword ramp). It is also possible to shoot a dodge lane to reset the timer and the spinners add seconds. A separate entrance called smash can also be used to attack directly. A dungeon hole to the right can be used to restore health when health potions have been collected.\n\nAfter defeating a monster a lane to the princess wheel in the bottom left part of the screen is opened up. The ball lands in a wheel with a bonus and after three balls princess multiball is activated. When all twelve monsters are defeated the wizard mode can be activated where the final opponent can only be defeated using magic. There are four magic scrolls to collect, mainly through the top left flipper that leads to the Orcanium area. There the flipper key or button is used to extend wooden poles that push the ball in one of four holes, providing a scroll. Magic can also be used during regular fights by going into Orcanium and outside of fights the Orcanium is used to challenge a monster through a theatre sequence. Other challenges are bat frenzy and skeleton swarm. There is also a wooden skillshot area near the top right of the screen.",

      "description": "<i>Destiny</i> is a futuristic first-person shooter set in a persistent world. When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player's character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.\n\nAt the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.\n\nShips are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.\n\nPlayers can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player's character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player's character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.\n\nThere are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference. The Crucible offers Crucible Marks as a currency along with Crucible Reputation.",

Set in a block world and played from a first-person perspective, players are free to explore, kill, craft and build. It is either played in the creative mode, with no dangers or limitations, or in the survival mode where enemies come out and can kill you and your creations. This version of the game supports worlds (usually randomly generated) that are much larger than the previous console versions.\n\nThere is a tutorial island where the basics can be practiced and pop-ins also appear with helpful explanations. The game supports split-screen for two or four players, and online games to up to eight. When creating a game it is possible to make it available online, or invite only. For both platforms there is a large amount of DLC with skin and texture packs.",

Lovecraft, Stefan Grabi\u0144ski and Algernon Blackwood. You play as detective Paul Prospero who has supernatural powers. He generally handles the tasks the police and priests won't touch. He receives letters from a boy called Ethan Carter that start out as fan mail, but soon it turns out Ethan can see things as well, and for his last case he travels to Red Creek Valley to find out what has happened to him.\n\nIt is an open world type of game that can be explored freely. There is no tutorial, HUD, journal or equipment \u2014 the order in which Prospero visits the locations can be chosen freely and generally there are no puzzles that need to be completed in a fixed order to progress. That way it is possible to start an investigation until stuck and then return to it later. There are also many optional parts.\n\nThe game combines both exploring the world and solving environmental puzzles, which mainly involve examining or finding missing pieces and then determining what the order of events was and then recreating it. Whenever something of interest is discovered, a text description appears on the screen and Prospero can use his vision to view it in the past. This leads him to new clues. The larger investigations require him to find multiple items or locations that are connected. Progress is shown through the central character or item that triggers the investigation. When enabling vision, the size of the vision circle determines how much has been found. Once all vital elements have been discovered Prospero needs to use his vision to determine the chronology. He visits the different locations or items, determines the order through a sequence of increasing numbers and then lets the vision play out. If successful, the sequence is completed and the investigation is resolved. If not, the sequence suddenly halts and the order of the chronology needs to be altered.",

      "description": "In <i>Crimes & Punishments: Sherlock Holmes</i>, the player controls the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The game is set in the late 19th century and, in contrast to the predecessors, tells not one big case but six smaller, independent ones. Three of them are original stories and two (<i>The Fate of Black Peter</i> and <i>The Abbey Grange Affair</i>) are based on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. <i>The Riddle on the Rails</i> takes the basic premise of Doyle's story <i>The Lost Train</i>, but the rest of the story is original. All cases involve Holmes investigating a murder.\n\nSolving crimes has four main components. The first part is investigating the environment: here the player controls Holmes either in first or third-person (the point & click interface of the predecessors is no longer available) and navigates him through the scenes, e.g. a garden or a mansion. When Holmes walks near something interesting, a notification pops up and after pressing a button, Holmes will make an observation or interact with the object. In some cases the game switches to first-person detail view of the object, e.g. a shelve, and the player moves a cursor in search for more hot-spots. When a smaller object is viewed in detail mode, it can be rotated. \"Finished\" hot-spots are marked and detail views are automatically exited when there is no more information to be found. Additionally there are two special viewing modes available which can be turned on when investigating the environment: instinct (allows Holmes to find small details) and imagination (Holmes recreates past events in his mind). Because those viewing modes are mandatory to find certain clues, there is a notification when they should be used.\n\nThe second component is interrogating suspects and witnesses. When entering conversation, Holmes has a number of topics to choose from. This results usually in an automatic dialogue between Holmes and the other persons, but in some cases Holmes can cut in when the person is lying. Then he is presented with a number of rebuttals and has to choose the correct one. Those are either previously collected clues or come from Holmes' deductions about the person: like in the novels, Holmes closely inspects the person's outside for conclusions about character and history. From a gameplay perspective, it is similar to the object detail view: moving a cursor over the person and clicking on hot-spots.\n\nThe third component are mini games which are frequently encountered while processing evidence or searching the environment, e.g. when opening a lock. The gameplay of those mini games have a wide range and can be puzzles, action-based or simply using things in the correct sequence. While most are short, some like creating a time-table of events can be a bit more involved. All mini games can be skipped. Additionally there are some inventory-based puzzles in which Holmes has to collect a few things to (automatically) use with another thing. \n\nThis all comes together in the fourth component: deductions. They are performed on a separate screen and lead to the resolution of the case. First there is a cluster of all clues Holmes has found so far and the player has to choose two which belong together and form a deduction, e.g. \"the victim was shot\" and \"the revolver has one bullet missing\" may lead to the deduction \"the victim was shot with the revolver\". Multiple deductions together lead to another deduction and eventually to the murderer or the next step to take in the investigation, e.g. a recreation of the crime. However, many clues can be interpreted differently and this is the player's job: choosing between two alternatives based on everything what was learned - different interpretations lead to different results. In the end, the player is free to choose the conclusion and the game does not prevent accusing the wrong suspect. However, after the case the player can optionally view if the choice was correct and jump back to the last decision. There is also always a moral choice to take which boils down to hitting the murderer with the full charge of the law or being lenient.\n\nAs the cases are independent, those choices don't have impact besides a letter or newspaper story which can be picked up during the next case. While most environments are exclusive to the case and are opened up one after another, there are two places which are visited in almost every case: Holmes' and Watson's home (used for research, processing evidence and changing Holmes' appearance) and Scotland Yard (used for interrogating arrested suspects and inspect their belongings, visit the morgue or converse with Inspector Lestrade). The player almost exclusively controls Holmes; other characters like Watson or the sniffer dog Toby are only controlled in a few sequences.",

      "description": "<i>Paranormal</i> is a DLC pinball table for Pinball FX2 (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows), Zen Pinball 2 (Mac, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U), and Zen Pinball (HD) (iOS and Android). The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. This table's theme is paranormal phenomena. As a paranormal detective you investigate hauntings and strange creatures.\n\nThe game has a basic set of flippers at the bottom and an additional one on the right to reach a separate ramp. By launching the ball through a long ramp on the right, it reaches another flipper in the top left. This flipper is used to shoot the ball up a set of stairs towards the door of a haunted mansion and another path to the right that leads to a cube. The flipper on the right accesses the Nessie ramp where a spinner can make you take snapshots of the Loch Ness monster. This ramp leads to a separate area below the main flippers with another flipper to reach another part on the right. Locking balls opens up a mini-game in the cube near the top, mainly to activate multiball phenomena.\n\nOther game elements include a poltergeist ball trapped on the left side of the table, a dizzy mode with a chupacabra, annoying the jersey devil, and a mission based around the bermuda triangle. When the door towards the haunted mansion is open, the ball can be launched inside, in a separate 2D area where the ball goes extremely fast. There are various targets and an upper floor. A UFO can take the ball up. There is also a LED video mini-game where you chase a mutant alligator and the flipper buttons are used to turn left or right at intersections.",

      "description": "<i>Driveclub</i> is a road racing game combining both offline and online races, but with a global experience level for both. The game's focus is on forming an online racing club with up to six racers in total. Each club member can race with a different car, but they can share emblems and decorations to distinguish themselves as a club. The score system ties the single-player performances to the online ones, where an entire club can benefit from a single player's successes, also unlocking new vehicles and events with cars on loan for players not yet at the required level, even when not doing club races. As a club, players can sign up for an event and then race another group. It is not possible to design a custom event, these are provided by the developers. While racing players earn points for different actions such as drafting and gaining positions, but these can also be deducted for cutting corners, ramming into other vehicles or slamming into obstacles. For certain collisions the player is punished with a penalty of three seconds with limited speed. At the end of the race it does not matter which player reaches first place, it is the total team score that determines which club wins. The performance of other players in a club can be tracked through a social hub.\n\nThe gameplay mixes arcade elements with simulation, as players are rewarded for being patient, learning corners and takeover opportunities, and following the ideal racing line. However, bumping into other cars and cutting them off is also possible. Next to the offline single races against AI-controlled cars there is a single-player tour. It is a campaign with about fifty events divided over five levels unlocked gradually by completing challenges and earning stars by reaching a top place, doing a cornering challenge, maintaining a certain average speed or beating a certain time. There are 225 stars in total to earn and with set amounts new events are opened up. Next to star points, fame points can be earned for the global experience level, also affecting the club. Even when doing single-player there is a social link, as you can see challenges by other players and create your own after doing well in a race as a type of asynchronous multiplayer. It is possible to browse all existing challenges and by beating them both you and your club earn points.\n\nThe cars are licensed and divided into five classes: Hot Hatches, Sports, Performance, Super and Hyper. Cars are unlocked gradually by reaching a new driver level. They are based on four main statistics: acceleration, top speed, handling and drifting, but tuning is not possible except for determining the colour, coating and manual or automatic transmission. The tracks are inspired by locations around the world and generally there are three types of events: time trials, regular track races and drifting challenges.",

      "description": "Fifteen years after the events of Ridley Scott's <i>Alien</i> Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda is looking for answers. She is an engineer working for Weiland-Yutani Corporation. When she finds out that the logs from USCSS Nostromo have been located and transported to Sevastopol space station she decides to join a small crew sent by Weiland-Yutani to retrieve the data. Little does she know that the ship that has found the logs reached Sevastopol with a terrifying passenger on board, the one that murdered the majority of station's population and left the survivors cowering in fear.   \n\n<i>Alien: Isolation</i> is a survival horror game. It is set on the Sevastopol space station where Amanda is searching for USCSS Nostromo logs. Sevastopol is split into many areas, and a certain degree of freedom is given to the player: areas may have several alternative routes to the goal, hidden rooms and ventilation shafts; also Amanda may (and later needs to) backtrack through the station. As the game goes on Amanda's tools will be upgraded and she will be able to get access to previously out of reach areas.    \n\nAmanda is an engineer, so she is able to loot containers and bodies for resources and craft devices like noisemakers, smoke bombs, or Molotov cocktails, mainly used to distract the enemy. Later she acquires a flashlight, a motion detector and several types of weapons to defend herself against humanoid enemies (groups of hostile survivors or androids). However, Amanda is not a fighter, and each encounter should be carefully planned. Many actions take some time, for example to use a medpack Amanda needs to stand perfectly still. \n\nWhen Amanda draws attention of the alien, stealth is the only way to survive. The alien cannot be harmed, and it kills Amanda in a single hit. In most cases it doesn't follow a predetermined scripted route, but instead relies on its senses to track Amanda down.\n\nIn addition to the main story mode there's Survivor mode in which the player needs to escape from a specially designed map fulfilling secondary objectives along the way, while being aggressively hunted by the alien. This mode includes online leaderboards.  ",

The PS3 and PS Vita versions are Cross-Buy. After buying that version, it can be transferred for free to the PS4 version as well.\n\nIn this table your are the captain of the Earth Defense Special Forces and you need to defend Pinball City against the Flip-Bot and his minions. The Flip-Bot is a huge robot in the top right part of the table and takes up a large portion of the screen. To defeat him ten medals need to be earned through different missions. You can attempt to attack the bot directly, you can fight mini-bosses and you have to help civilians escape. In the City Destroyer mission you need to keep the ball in the upper part of the playfield for ten seconds. In Data Bowl you hit the drop targets in front of the Flip-Bot to steal the robot plans. In Artillery you use the launch cannon to choose a trajectory and then you have a limited amount of time to reach that target. You can also save a girl and there is an airstrike and a panic multiball with many jackpot lanes. The robot can toy with the ball by launching shots, changing the ball's trajectory. In Invasion you have a limited amount of time to shoot the ball into the rescue hole to stop the invasion. If not, Flip-Bot keeps adding balls (up to three) until you are overwhelmed.\n\nThe table focuses on the robot and the two large ramps reach around it. There is also a center ramp and an additional flipper in the top right next to the regular ones to reach another lane. Many activities are activated by launching the ball over the same ramp multiple times in succession. The left part of the screen is used to access a cannon, a subway to transport civilians, and a large UFO. There are two outlanes on the right and three on the left. Most of the targets can be found in the middle of the screen.",

      "description": "<i>Paranautical Activity</i> is a first-person shooter game which uses elements of the roguelike genre. It uses a retro graphical style, with all objects and room architecture made of large cuboid voxels. The game takes place in randomly generated levels, where the player fights their way through a series of rooms. In each room the player must kill all enemies (such as flying skulls, giant spiders, ninjas etc.) to open the door to the next chamber. The final room contains a boss monster. Killing the boss rewards the player with an upgrade and allows him to access the next, more dangerous level. \n\nAt the beginning of the game the player can choose one of the five classes, each with a different health, speed and starting equipment. The game uses a permanent death mechanic, similar to roguelikes; dying at any point forces the player to lose all game progress. There are a number of power-ups available, which can be both found dropped by bosses, and bought in special shop rooms where gold dropped by dead enemies can be exchanged for items. Effects of the power-ups include increased weapon damage, attracting money, the ability to double-jump, the necessity to use health instead of gold to pay in shops, and more. ",

      "description": "<i>Far Cry 4</i> is the fourth main game in the open world action series. It has no narrative ties to Far Cry 3, but carries over many gameplay elements. The game is set in Kyrat, a fictional region based on the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is governed by the depostic king Pagan Min. The player controls Ajay Ghale, an American with Kyrati roots who returns to the region to disperse his deceased mother's ashes. As soon as he arrives he is dragged into the conflict and is rescued by the rebel organization The Golden Path started by his parents. During the game the Ajay can eventually choose which force to side with, with different endings. Inside The Golden Path there is a power struggle, and Ajay can choose between missions for Amita or Sabal, with different objectives based on the choices.\n\nThe mountainous region has both lush environments and snowy mountains. Vertical heights can be scaled using a grappling hook, and a glider or a zipline is used to move down. The player can follow the story missions or explore freely. Various vehicles are available to cross the distances and there is a fast travel option for important locations. There is an auto drive option where vehicles follow the roads to the next waypoint while the player can concentrate on shooting. Typical game elements that return are hunting animals (rhinos, pigs, bears, eagles, wolves, elephants ...) to craft upgrades, collecting plants for syringes, exploring locations for loot that can be sold at shops, trading points and sherpas, and a large amount of weapons including a bow, both melee weapons and long-ranged guns, grenades, mines, and explosives. It is possible to ride elephants as well. Next to the main quest there are various side quests and random karma events for separate karma points. Next to money and experience gained to level up, skills points are provided. These can be spent in The Tiger (aggressive) or The Elephant (defensive) skill tree. There are also a large amount of collectibles such as propaganda posters, masks, lost letters and pages of Mohan Ghale's journal.\n\nBell towers can be climbed to remove the fog from sections of the map. There are 24 outposts to infiltrate and four large fortresses. It is possible to reset outposts to take them over using another tactic. Guns for hire tokens can be used to call in back-up for tough missions. Just like the previous game a stealth approach is always possible. Ajay can shoot open cages or throw bait to use wild animals to cause havoc. Stones can be thrown as a distraction. Both animals and enemies can be tagged with the camera to track movement. An indicator shows if Ajay has been discovered and guards have different alert states. Enemies can be taken out silently using a takedown, a throwing knife, weapons with a suppressor or the bow. The hunter is a new type of enemy that moves silently and can only be tagged for a short time. They quickly disappear, attempt to take you out and can charm animals to attack you. The game has a day and night cycle and Ajay can now sleep in a bed for a certain amount of time to skip the night for instance.\n\nThe single-player campaign can be played cooperatively (except for the main story missions). When playing alone and in a difficult situation, you can send a request for help for someone to join you, and vice versa. Online multiplayer is also supported through Battles of Kyrat, with different types of game modes such as Outpost, Demon Mask or Propaganda. Players who do not own the game can be invited to play along using a limited amount of keys. A level editor is included as well.",

The PS3 and PS Vita version are Cross-Buy. The PS3 version can be transferred to the PS4 version for free. It is based on the Marvel comic book character Doctor Strange. The world is threatened by two dimensional rulers: Nightmare and Dormammu. You need to help Doctor Strange, called the Sorcerer Supreme who protects Earth against mystical threats, to stop the invasion.\n\nThere is a basic set of flippers at the bottom and an additional one in the top left. The bottom of the table has three outlanes on each side. The design is largely focused on various long ramps and loops where shots can be combined quickly into combos. They also provide a path around the back of the table and are used to reach the spinners, as well as through the additional flipper. There are four jackpots in total and different abilities can be leveled up, such as intellect, wisdom and spirit, with short 'hurry up' sequences. There are trainings to complete, such as the arcane training and the alchemy training. When the two trainings are completed a multiball is activated.\n\nThe main missions for Doctor Strange are activated by shooting down the droptargets below him. For Strange, as well as the three other characters (Nightmare, Dormammu and Baron Mordo) two missions are available for each. They also appear as animated characters on the table. When the wisdom level is completed a hole in the middle of the playfield is activated. It leads to a mini playfield based around the Eye of Agamotto.",

      "description": "<i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i> is the eleventh main game in the first-person shooter series. The single-player campaign is set in the future, around 2054, when Atlas, a private military corporation led by Jonathan Irons, has become the most powerful military organization on the planet. The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack's father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq.\n\nAs the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier's abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other <i>Call of Duty</i> games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy.\n\nFor multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the <i>Black Ops II</i> Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly.\n\nLike many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. One to four players work together to survive multiple rounds, fighting off waves of enemies. There are four tiers to unlock and eleven rounds in total.",

      "description": "<i>The Crew</i> is a racing game set in an open world environment of a scaled-down version of the United States. Players have the ability to drive from coast to coast with the inclusion of major cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and New York, as well as specific locales such as Pikes Peak, the Laguna Seca race track, famous landmarks such as Cape Canaveral, many highways and smaller towns. In the single-player campaign the player controls Alex Taylor. He is a witness to the murder on his brother Datton, the leader of a crew called the 5-10's, but is arrested himself. Five years later he is given the opportunity by the FBI to hunt down his brother's killer Dennis 'Shiv' Jefferson, the gang's leader, as he is deployed to unmask the corrupt FBI agent Coburn who is also involved. He has to join the crew himself and make a name for himself to rise up the ranks.\n\nThe missions consist of a large amount of races and cut-scenes further the story, but there are also smaller challenges called 'skills' such as slalom courses, staying on the ideal racing line, making big jumps to cross gaps and maintaining a certain speed for a set distance. Skills are triggered by driving through them. Next to regular checkpoints races against the clock or opponents there are specific tasks such as stealing a certain car, transporting packages, escaping from cops, performing takedowns or chauffeuring. As Taylor rises up the ranks and get tasks from the crew's tiers V, V2, V4, V6 and eventually V8, new areas open up. The entire world is available right away, but the missions in the areas to the west only open up when a certain level has been reached and events usually recommend a car of a certain level.\n\nCars do not need to follow roads and can generally race on any type of terrain. There are specs for each type of environment that enhance performance, such as Circuit, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Street, but not all cars have access to all of them. The game world uses a day-and-night cycle and a large map can be used to plan a route with navigation. Taylor gains experience to level up and the same applies to the cars. Regularly new car parts are supplied, often based on his performance, to upgrade the car. With each new level perks become available, used to give Taylor an experience boost or to further enhance the cars.\n\nNext to the solo parts players can join crews to share the experience, work together and progress quicker. Crews of up to four people can form temporarily alliances with online players or with friends. Up to eight players are supported simultaneously in a single session. After the initial of the parts factions become available, such as the Eagles on the East Coast and the Wolves in the Midwest. Players get to join a certain faction to access PvP and PvE races. Joining a crew is the only way to earn crew credits, a secondary currency to buy perks and cars. The game supports microtransactions with real money to buy cars, but you cannot acquire any above your current level. This is never required to progress in the game. Crew credits can also be bought as large credits packs.\n\nEach crew has a crew leader who can take a number of decisions, such as restarting a mission. There is also a large amount of social features to track scores and compare with friends. The game contains many types of cars from licensed manufacturers such as Aston Martin, Bentley, BMW and Ferrari. After the main game has been completed and level 50 is hit, platinum car parts can be obtained, as opposed to the gold ones, encouraging players to continue racing as these provide a random statistics boost to get the best possible car for PvP matches at the highest level.",

      "description": "<i>P.T.</i> was a first-person survival horror game. Originally launched as a free game in a new franchise by the indie studio 7780s Studio, finishing the game reveals P.T. stands for Playable Teaser and the game is actually developed by Kojima Productions as a teaser for the then upcoming but eventually cancelled game <i>Silent Hills</i>. The section was said not to be part of the game. The game starts with the protagonist who wakes up in a dark room. A door leads into an L-shaped hallway with photos and various items. The hallway appears to loop around while a radio broadcast lets the player know a man has murdered his family and later killed himself. Through various loops of the same hallway and a few surrounding rooms, gradually various forms of paranormal activity occur, with sounds, changes in lighting, apparitions and many other types of events. \n\nThere is no combat system and the focus is entirely on exploration. There are also only puzzles in the sense that certain events can be encountered, as there is no HUD or any direct means to interact with the environment except for movement. After a certain event is triggered based on various conditions, the game ends and a trailer for <i>Silent Hills</i> is shown.",

      "description": "<i>Dying Light</i> is an open world, action horror game. It takes place in a zombie apocalypse environment, similar to the Dead Island games by the same developer. The game is set in the large city of Harran, with influences of ancient Turkey, overrun by a mysterious epidemic. The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system \u2013 during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies, weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger and more dangerous.\n\nThe focus is on melee weapons and just like in <i>Dead Island</i> various materials can be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the character's abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike games such as Assassin's Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.\n\nProgress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane. Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the game's pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps, sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a dynamic weather system.\n\n<i>Dying Light</i> offers an online co-op mode for up to four players. In the Be the Zombie mode there is asymmetrical multiplayer where one player-controlled powerful Night Hunter can invade another player's game at night and up to four players can work together to defeat it.\n\nOn 9th February the game was updated for free to an <i>Enhanced Edition</i> version for all platforms through a patch. This <i>Enhanched Edition</i> then replaced the default version of the game.",

      "description": "<i>Evolve</i> is an asymmetrical multiplayer game for five players. It is played with a team of four humans against a single monster, all controlled by human players. It does not contain a separate single-player mode, but the game can be played by a single player with up to four bots controlling the remaining spots. The game is set in the future and takes place at Shear, a planet far away that has been colonized. The valuable colonies are soon attacked by different kinds of monsters. To deal with the threat, war veteran William Chabot is brought out of retirement and he assembles a team of hunters to eliminate the monsters.\n\nThe human side consists of four classes. There are Assaults (damage), Medics (health), Supports (tools) and Trappers (Tracking). Players assemble a team with any combination of the classes to hunt down the monster. There are multiple characters per class with different secondary skills and abilities and each class has different general abilities. Assaults use a personal shield for temporary invulnerability, Medics use health burst to provide health in a radius, Supports can activate a radius of cloaking, and Trappers use a Mobile Arena energy dome shield to narrow down the area where the monster can be found. Secondary skills are different for each character. Hunter Abe for instance has a track dart gun to track monsters or tag food (which marks the monster when it is consumed). The other Hunter Griffin can deploy spikes to detect and movement and the Hunter Maggie releases a pet trapjaw to chase after the monster's trail. Next to the permanent perk and the basic customization system, the full roster of characters is unlocked by reaching the mastery level for the skills. This can also be done in solo matches and it applies to the monsters as well.\n\nThere are three types of monsters to choose from. Goliath is a durable melee monster. It can charge, use its fire breath, and perform a leap smash or a rock throw. Kraken is a flying monster that attacks from long range using electricity. It has access to aftershock (energy burst), banshee mines, lightning strike and vortex. Wraith is a stealth monster. It uses abduction to get a character away from the team, can create a decoy version of itself, create a supernova (radial destruction along with damage and attack speed buff), and perform a warp blast to teleport and do damage at the same time. Additional characters and monsters are included in special editions of the game or can be bought as DLC. They do no split the community as players who do not own the DLC can still fight the additional characters and monsters, but cannot play them. Additional maps are released for free for all players.\n\nMonsters can feed on wildlife and dead humans to fill an energy meter and evolve. This is used to become stronger, but to evolve they have to enter a cocoon stage for a while that leaves them very vulnerable. Wildlife can attack both sides, influencing the events, and can reveal locations. Both sides can use different types of power-ups and need to use a strategic approach to overcome the opposition.\n\nThe game modes are Defend, Hunt, Nest and Rescue. In Defend the humans need to defend a starship's refueling station by protecting power generators until the ship is fully refueled. The opposition controls a single, fully evolved monster, along with various Goliath minions. The monster must destroy the two generators to reach the ship's power source before it is refueled. In Hunt the monster wins by killing all humans or by evolving to stage three to destroy a power relay, while the humans merely need to destroy the monster. The monster receives a head start to get away before the humans are dropped. When the monster dies the game is over immediately. When a hunter is killed there is a wait time of three minutes before respawning. In Nest the monster needs to defend six monster eggs somewhere in the environment for ten minutes. The eggs can be hatched to receive help from minions. Humans have ten minutes to destroy all eggs. In Rescue both the humans and the monster go after injured colonists spread over the map. The first to rescue or kill five respectively, wins the session.\n\nGames can be played as Quick Play sessions or in the Evacuation story mode. In the second type each won match in a cycle of five brings an advantage to the next map for that side and it ends with a Defend match. There are different types of maps with distinct themes such as a jungle or using industrial elements.",

      "description": "<i>Battlefield Hardline</i> is a first-person shooter and the first game in the series to focus on urban crime instead of military warfare. The game is done by a different developer and the single-player portion of the game is split up into ten episodes modeled after an episodic TV series format, including a preview of the next episode at the end and a recap of the previous one when starting a new episode.\n\nThe game is set in Miami, Los Angeles, the deserts in California and many other locations around the world. They often offer a sandbox-like approach with multiple, non-linear options to complete objectives. The protagonist is the young detective Nicholas Mendoza who follows a drug supply chain with his partner Khai Minh Dao. The game mixes classic first-person shooter mechanics with non-lethal actions to resemble a realistic police approach, including stealth and the ability to hold criminals at gunpoint and flash a badge to perform an arrest rather than shooting them. The latter is also rewarded with more points. When enemies operate in groups it is often possible to lure one away. As a detective Mendoza can also use a scanner to locate evidence. These lead to separate cases that can be solved and clues are often divided over multiple episodes. When a case is solved a short conclusion cut-scene is shown, some more of the background story is revealed, and a new weapon or item is provided as a reward. The weapons in the single-player part are generally lighter than usual for the series. The pistol is the primary weapon and more powerful ones are generally unlockable assault rifles rather than military-grade machine guns. Throwables such as grenades are also not used. A taser can be used to subdue suspects without killing them. These are presented as Open Warrants, optional objectives to arrest with specific characters who also often carry evidence.\n\nThe multiplayer arsenal is more similar to Battlefield 4 with grenades, rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. There is a global ranking system based on experience. This is shown through French playing cards with over 150 different rank insignia. Coins are earned by completing specific objectives and for a number of coins a bounty is provided. Service Stars are provided for progression towards specific objectives, divided over multiple tiers. There are bronze, silver and gold stars and they provide additional weapon attachments and vehicle modifications, unique weapon parts and cosmetic appearances for the different classes. Assignments from the previous games also return, rewarded with new items, attachments and patches for completing general assignments. Syndicate assignments, similar to Phantom assignments in <i>Battlefield 4</i>, are harder to complete and provide additional weapons.\n\nThe four main classes in multiplayer games are largely similar to those in the previous game, but modeled after police and criminal forces. Enforcers are hard hitters with additional gadgets, Mechanics are able to repair vehicles, sabotage bombs and use a satellite phone to generate spawn points, Operators are light fighters with medical gadgets, and Professionals focus on intelligence and stealth with range attacks as well as cameras, decoys and mines. Next to the classic Team Deathmatch and Conquest game modes that support up to 64 players, five new multiplayer modes are available with two sides: law enforcement and criminals.\n\nIn Blood Money both sides need to retrieve money from a location in the center of the map and return it to an armored truck. The first team to deposit $5 million or to have the most money when time runs out wins. It is possible to steal from each other's truck. Crosshair is played 5-on-5 with a single life for each player and a session that lasts three minutes. The criminals need to kill a VIP while law enforcement needs to secure the VIP to an extraction point. Heists has the criminals break into vaults or armoured trucks to bring crash to an extraction point while the police attempts to stop them. Hotwire is similar to the flags in Conquest, but they are replaced by drivable cars. Just like in Conquest the game is won by capturing them, but the cars need to be driven at a certain speed to reduce the reinforcement tickets for the other side. Up to four players can board a single car and while one drives the other three can lean out of the windows to shoot. The game is won by removing all opposing tickets or by having the most when time runs out. Just like Crosshair, Rescue is played 5-on-5 with sessions that last three minutes and players only have a single life. Law enforcement is represented by S.W.A.T. officers that need to free hostages or kill the criminals. The criminals win by killing all officers.\n\nVehicles are generally faster than those in the previous games. They include regular cars, jeeps, vans, trucks, tankers, bikes and different types of helicopters (scout, transport, fighters ...). By using a zipline to traverse between buildings various alternative approaches can be used. Next to the standard equipment pick-ups and additional weapons can be found while playing.",

      "description": "<i>Primal Carnage: Extinction</i> is a class based multiplayer game featuring man versus dinosaur battles with players commanding both sides. Originally planned as a free update to its predecessor, it now serves as the sequel to the 2012 game Primal Carnage and it was created by a new development team.\n\nThis game is on a lot of fronts the same as the first one, only different for certain aspects. The game features the same dinosaur classes as the original and only the skins are different: Tyrannosaurus Rex, Spinosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Carnotaurus, Pteranodon and the non-existing species Novaraptor. Human classes are also the same and include the Trapper, Commando, Scientist, Pathfinder and Pyromaniac. The human classes did get new weapons and a loadout system is now in effect instead of only being able to use one set. \n\nThe game includes all maps of the first game and its updates, and the map rotation is strengthened by three new maps: Transfer, Verdant, and Contingency. All game modes from the last game are also available here, including the 'Get to the Chopper' mode later added through an update to the <i>Primal Carnage</i>.\n\nThe game is more supported through Steam than its predecessor, having tradeable human skins, dinosaur skins, weapon skins, and hats and accessories for both human and dinosaur characters.",

      "description": "<i>Zombie Army Trilogy</i> is a tactical first-person shooter based on Sniper Elite V2. It includes two spin-off standalone titles only available for PC: Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army and Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2. These two games were remastered and put into a single campaign with a new, third episode not available separately. For the PS4 and the Xbox One this is the first release for any of the content. Owners of the first two games on Steam were offered a 60% discount to upgrade.\n\nThe story details an alternate history where Hitler unleashes an undead horde from his bunker at the end of World War II in a final attempt to take over the world. Unlike <i>Sniper Elite V2</i> the game is not played from the American side, but as the Germans who need to stop this undead assault. The gameplay is largely identical to <i>Sniper Elite V2</i> as the game puts a focus on a tactical approach and stealth with long-range rifles as a primary weapon and other weapons such as a machine gun, a pistol or a bazooka as a secondary weapon. There are also grenades, trip wire traps, land mines, dynamite sticks and a kick as a melee attack. The tactical approach is most noticeable at higher level difficulty levels that introduce wind contingencies, bullet drop physics, a heart rate to control, and an impact on the stance. Most of the objectives are based on reaching a checkpoint or retrieving relics. The trademark anatomical cutaway X-ray view is still present.\n\nThe three episodes offer fifteen levels in total. The third one, <i>Beyond Berlin</i>, has larger and broader maps that offer more room for exploration and experimentation. This one also introduces the traps and decoys that can be used. The five levels for the third episode are City of Ashes, Freight Train of Fear, Forest of Corpses, The Keep, and Army of Darkness. There are three difficulty levels (Cadet, Marksman and Sniper Elite) and options for enemy setup customization. Next to the four existing male characters, the cast of playable characters is expanded with four female ones: Anya Bochkareva, Beth Coleman, Hanna Schulz and Marie Chevalier. Prior to starting a mission the loadout can be define with a rifle, a secondary weapon and a pistol, and the additional items such as mines or grenades. The game supports cooperative games for up to four players and introduces new a Horde survival mode on five new maps.",

      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</i> is a standalone expansion to 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order. Players once again step into the shoes of Polish-American OSA Operative William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, this time in a prequel to the events that kick off the original games plot. The year is 1946 and the Allies are losing the war to the Nazis due to the technological superiority afforded to the Nazis by one General Wilhelm Strasse. He is more commonly known by his alias \"Deathshead\", a scientific genius who is developing great and terrible technology that could cripple the Allies once and for all. In order to have any chance of defeating Deathshead, the allies must first find the location of Deathshead's hidden compound to strike at the source. However the location of Deathshead's compound is known by only one other member of the Reich:  SS Paranormal division leader Helga Von Schabbs, a mad woman who has sequestered herself in the massive and notorious Castle Wolfenstein. Thus B.J. is sent in to infiltrate Castle Wolfenstein and find the location of Deathshead's base, as well as learn of the dark secrets surrounding the castle itself while also coming face to face with the ferocious thug Rudi J\u00e4ger.\n\nThe game plays almost identically to <i>The New Order</i>, meaning that the game features a blend of stealth action as well as fast-paced and brutal first-person combat. Players can switch freely between play styles to suit how they wish to play through the game. There is a traditional health and armour meter, with only 20 points of health regenerating at a time rather than regaining a full bar of health. Health can also be overcharged by consuming medkits when at full health, however this overcharge is only temporary and should be used smartly and sparingly. Armour can be scavenged from the corpses of foes as well as found in the many hidden nooks and crannies in the game which also hides treasures and other goodies throughout the levels. Combat is carried out with numerous modified takes on historical weapons, as well as some experimental. Most of them can also be dual wielded by the player for extra power but decreased accuracy.  New to the game are the pipes, which replace the knives and allow B.J. to tamper with more electrical devices as well as climbing certain walls. The game includes a simple, context sensitive cover system which simply allows a player to hide behind cover automatically when crouching or taking spot behind a sufficient piece of cover and leaning in and out to fire.\n\nNew to this game are the challenges, small portions of the game that are unlocked as you play through the campaign which allow you to take on specific mini-challenges and survive numerous foes in order to obtain a high score.",

Your goal: Reach the exit of the level by jumping through the world, shooting enemies and apples.\n\nThe game is split up intro 5 worlds, with each of them introducing some new gameplay element. The basic principle is always the same though: Whenever something happens that shouldn't have happened the level is reset. Reasons for the reset are (amongst others) when you touch or are being hit by an enemy, when you fall off the platforms or when one of those mentioned apples hits the ground. You are equipped with a simple gun with unlimited ammunition that can be used to shoot enemies and objects. The levels also contain several time critical situations, as entering certain areas will trigger events: for example catapults in the distance will throw the apples into the air or small knobs will generate a sphere that has to be left quickly.\n\nIn practice this feels a bit like trickjumping in games like the Quake series: You will have to run and jump through the level to reach that falling apple in time while at the same time shooting mandatory enemies and blocking obstacles.\n\nBe warned however: The game's graphics and presentation are very cute and family friendly, but the gameplay is designed to be very challenging.",

      "description": "<i>Project CARS</i> is a racing simulation similar to the Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports and GTR FIA Racing series. Different to those titles the game does not offer initial content where the player has to race and earn experience to perform upgrades and additional cars and tracks. Instead, all of the content is available right away and players can race in any mode, class, car and on any circuit immediately. Similar to games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa it offers very detailed customization where players can fine-tune almost any aspect of the cars, but contrary to those two titles there is not only multiplayer racing, but also a full career mode with offline races against AI-controlled opponents. Optionally various assists can be enabled to simply the gameplay.\n\nThe game offers circa 70 cars in various types of motorsports such as classic retro tour cars, traditional road cars, karts, track day cars, supercars, modern open wheel cars, GT cars and Le Mans prototypes. Brands include Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Ford, Lotus, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Renault and more. Brands such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are not included. Certain cars are part of a modified car pack, some are tied to a specific edition and others are given away for free each month. The game includes a large amount of racing circuits from around the world as well as a number of fictional ones and also point-to-point races.\n\nThe career mode offers several goals to climb the ranks, win championships and earn contracts to race in higher series. Examples of challenges include <i>Defending Champ</i> to win three seasons in a row undefeated, <i>Triple Crown</i> to win three different types of championships and <i>Zero to Hero</i> where you go through championships for the different race classes, from karts to Formula 1. There are several championships presented as race weekends split up in practice rounds, qualifiers and race sessions that often consist of multiple races. Optionally certain sessions can be skipped or simulated. It is possible to design custom races, there are various weather conditions and the developers organize events regularly. Online multiplayer is not done through matchmaking but through playlists curated by the developer. Next to regular races it is possible to challenge other players to time trials. The Driver Network keeps track of the player's progress, stats and results for the various cars and parts of the game. \n\n<i>CARS</i> from the title is an acronym for <i>Community Assisted Racing Simulator</i>, which reflects the game's development. The game was crowd funded where contributors could involve themselves in the development through Tool Packs which allowed for the creation of assets, content, QA and other parts of the development process with various rewards.",

      "description": "<i>Ziggurat</i> is a first-person shooter similar to Tower of Guns that borrows many elements from the roguelike games. Game elements include permadeath, randomized environments and enemies, random pick-ups, weapons, items and skills. The game has a fantasy theme and the protagonist is an apprentice of the Greyborn citadel, established by the Daedalon brothers wizards, where aspiring wizards are trained. Their final test is the Ziggurat where novices go to die or survive and become part of the citadel's inner circle.\n\nThe tower-like Ziggurat consists of several floors that need to be completed with a single life. The game has permadeath but it is possible to save progress after completing a floor to continue another time. The game emphasizes fast-paced movement including sprinting, jumping and using platforms in the environment, fighting against large hordes in small rooms, but optionally auto-aiming can be enabled. Each floor is generated with a random pattern and it consists of several floors linked together by corridors. To complete a level a guardian boss needs to be defeated, but it can only be summoned when a portal key has first been located elsewhere. A typical room spawns a large amount of minions that need to be defeated before the doors open again. There is a chance of a random effect when entering a room, for instance creating larger enemies, doing more damage, making them invisible etc.\n\nOther types of rooms that can be part of a floor are a treasure room with a powerful item, a hazard room where an environmental hazard needs to be avoided, a shrine where health or mana can be offered to the gods in exchange for an additional effect or modifier, and a lore room where an ancient scroll can be found, providing knowledge. Each floor also has a secret room hidden behind a cracked wall. Inside one of two skills can be chosen and it also shows information about one of the developer's earlier games.\n\nAt the start the player chooses one of several characters with different statistics and modifiers, presented as different classes, but only one is available in the beginning as the others are unlocked gradually. The default weapons is a magic wand that shoots projectiles. It has unlimited ammo, but requires some time for ammo to be refilled entirely. Three additional types of weapons can be picked up, tied to three limited mana sources. Each mana source offers several weapons per type, but only one per type can be carried at all times, so a maximum of four weapons in total. At the start of a floor a new weapon is always offered to optionally pick up or exchange. Each weapon has a regular attack, and a powerful attack that consumes more. Weapons include staffs, grenades, homing projectiles, charges that freeze opponents etc. They all use ranged attacks so the character needs to keep a distance, but still needs to move in to collect the items left behind by defeated enemies before they vanish.\n\nUnlike many roguelike games the game emphasizes combat skills to survive instead of relying on the randomness of provided items. By defeating enemies and for instance locating lore, experience is gained to level up. The character becomes stronger, but with each new level a selection between two random skills is offered so the player has a choice what skills or perks to use. Examples of skills are improved health or mana, reduced consumption rates, additional health for entering a new room or breaking objects, more or less loot drops, amulets to receive health or mana at a specific moment etc. Defeated enemies also leave behind health, mana and other types of objects. After each game session additional weapons, items, characters, skills, game modes and difficulty levels are unlocked gradually, to use in a next one.",

      "description": "<i>Farming Simulator 15</i> is the 2015 edition of the farming simulation series. It largely continues the gameplay from the previous games in a sandbox environment. Players start with a small farm and by managing it efficiently the scope can be expanded while profits bring in new and better gear such as powerful tractors, harvesters and high capacity trailers. As in the previous games almost every action, such as connecting attachments, sowing, fertilization, plowing, harvesting, taking produce to the market and feeding animals need to be done manually. Two new types of activities for this release are animal husbandry and forestry, but at a high starting cost. For forestry players can plant and cut down trees. The wood can be sold to a lumber mill and wood chippings to a heating plant. Many new types of vehicles and machines are introduced for this activity.\n\nThis time there are two types of settlements to choose from to build a farm. There is the village Bjornholm with Scandinavian influences and Westbridge Hills with a US-influence. The general gameplay is identical for both settlements with similar delivery points such as train stations and windmills, but the American town has larger fields, making it more challenging. This game adds 20 new licensed manufacturers for equipment, such as New Holland tractors, MAN trucks, Ponsse, Case IH, Deutz-Fahr etc. with 140 vehicles and farming tools in total. Also new is the ability to control washing equipment from a first-person perspective to clean machinery and implements. Even though there is a sandbox environment, there are many types of missions and objectives that are rewarded with cash for completing them.\n\nAll versions except PS3 and Xbox 360 support cooperative online games. Several players (up to six for PS4/Xbox One) can work together and the host can bring his single-player game online for others to participate, while at the same time carefully managing them, for instance by not making all cash available to everyone, but providing sums where needed along with several other limitations the host can define.",

      "description": "<i>Ride</i> is a motorcycle racing simulation that aims to recreate a realistic racing experience without any arcade elements. At the start the player designs a character and gets to choose between three bikes from the slowest category (under 700 CC). The main game modes are World Tour, Quick Mode (quick races and time trials) and Online. Most of the content is unlocked through the World Tour. By participating in different events, 'reputation' is earned to buy new bikes and accessories. Bikes can be fully customized based on the appearance, brakes and suspensions, engine, transmission and wheels. Every main category is further split up in different components. For the engine for instance the player can determine the air filter, cylinder head porting, electronic control unit, exhaust and oil type. Components and bikes come from licensed manufacturers, both historic and modern. The general statistics for bikes are acceleration, braking power, handling and top speed.\n\nThe world tour events consists of leagues such as naked bikes (middleweight and heavyweight groups), supersports, historic superbikes, modern superbikes, pro circuit, premium events (extremely limited bikes) and open races. Most of them only become available after acquiring the right type of bike. There are about 100 bikes in total, with displacements ranging from 250 to 1,299 cc and manufactured between 1987 and 2015. Each league is further split up in multiple groups of events. Racing events include single races, championships, drag races, endurance, head-to-head, time attack, track day (overtake a number of riders) on circuits inspired by real ones (GP tracks) and more general, open terrain races (city, country etc.). The Team Race game mode requires a team mate as the results of both riders combined determines the final standing. The team mate is a character that can be chosen, but is also possible to download the rider profile and appearance of a friend.\n\nThe game contains three simulation levels: Semi Pro, Standard and Pro. They influence the handling of the bike and sometimes lock guides at higher levels. Physics elements include auto brakes, joint brakes, an anti wheelie option, tuck-in, different settings for following the ideal trajectory (shown through coloured arrows on the track to show the best line and recommended speed), the type of transmission and influence over TCS (traction). The game also takes into account how the track evolves over multiple laps with rubbered in black marks that offer better grip. At lower levels it is possible to use multiple rewinds, allowing the player to rewind time after a mistake. Before each race the settings of the bike can be adjusted, based on the suspension (preload, spring stiffness, compression damping, rebound damping), handlebars and gears. While racing the player controls acceleration and braking (front and rear brake), shifting gears, steering, shifting weight, adjusting TCS and tuck-in. There are different camera options and it is possible to look to the sides or behind to keep an eye on the other racers.\n\nMultiplayer includes split-screen for two players, single races for up to twelve players and championships with multiple races in succession.",

      "description": "<i>A Knight to Remember</i> is the first installment of the five-part King's Quest: The Complete Collection episodic adventure series and a reboot/re-imagining of the classic <i>King's Quest</i> adventure franchise. It mixes sparse action elements and exploration with puzzle-solving.\n\nThe first episode starts without context as Graham climbs down a wishing well. He is there on a quest for King Edward to retrieve a magic mirror, guarded by a giant dragon, a story element that was also part of the first <i>King's Quest</i> game. It is then revealed this story is told as a flashback by an old Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn. Different stories in the past are mixed up with sections in the present where Gwendolyn is controlled. Her choices are defined by those made by the player in Graham's stories, as they are her inspiration. For instance, in this episode she fights her cousin Gart in a tournament and the way the fight develops is entirely determined through Graham's actions in the earlier stories.\n\nAfter retrieving the magic mirror another story tells how Graham first went to Daventry to become a knight. He wants to enter a tournament, but he is late and misses the Parade of Hopeful Knights and the Test of Chivalry. After helping out some people to get back inside the castle and re-taking the test, he needs to earn his entrance ticket by bringing back the eye of a hideous beast. This brings him back to the well with the dragon. He competes with aspiring knights in fights, meets many different characters sometimes with the option to help them out, and there are many exploration and action sequences, even a board game played with mechanical units. Choices and consequences are carried over between episodes and especially influence how Gwendolyn will act. Generally, there are implicitly three paths to follow: bravery, wisdom or compassion. The game ends with the fight between Gwendolyn and Gart.\n\nWhen not purchasing <i>King's Quest: The Complete Collection</i> for the whole season, this first episode acts as the base game to buy King's Quest: Season Pass (episodes 2-5) as DLC or separate episodes (PlayStation only).",

      "description": "<i>King's Quest: The Complete Collection</i> is a five-part episodic adventure series and a reboot/re-imagining of the classic <i>King's Quest</i> adventure franchise. The protagonist is Graham, the same protagonist who first appeared in the original King's Quest in 1984. The entire game is told as a flashback narrated by the old Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn, similar to the story structure of King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, set in a fantasy universe and with a humorous tone. When Graham dies in the game, he often rewinds the story a bit or remarks it was not what he did. His narration is also heard during regular gameplay, especially for descriptions of the environment. The game offers entirely new stories and characters, but they often reference the earlier games. The new stories are not told in a chronological order and they are interspersed with sections in the present that revolve around Gwendolyn.\n\nThe game environment is shown through different perspectives for each scene with scrolling parts, but the camera cannot be controlled. Visually it has a cel-shaded graphical style. The player can move Graham freely in the 3D environment. When he is close to an interesting element, this is signified through one or multiple icons in the bottom right corner of the screen. The player can choose to examine, interact or pick up. Collected items are stored in an inventory. In many locations it is possible to switch to a first-person perspective to examine the environment. The game largely focuses on the story and puzzle-solving, but there is also a large amount of exploration of the environment and action sequences with escapes and fighting. Graham often needs to run and he can also push or manipulate objects in various ways, which is more prominent than using items in the inventory. These sections are sometimes shown from a first-person perspective. There are also many cut-scenes, on-rails sequences and some Quick Time Events.\n\nThe game incorporates choices and consequences in various ways and they are carried across episodes. There are many branching dialogue options (without a timer unlike in many <i>Telltale</i> games) that lead to different outcomes. In addition, puzzles often have multiple approaches without a fixed solution. The game initially starts in a confined environment, but soon opens up with a large place to explore. The way Graham solves puzzles also has consequences, for instance by choosing to involve a specific character when this leads to a negative outcome. Generally there are three types of choices to make or paths to follow: bravery, wisdom or compassion, even though these are never mentioned explicitly. This affects the story and especially the way Gwendoline will act in the present as her grandfather's stories are the inspiration for her acts. These choices were sometimes also present in the early <i>King's Quest</i> game, for instance the way Graham could deal with the dragon in the first game.\n\nThe game consists of five chapters:\n<ul>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter I - A Knight to Remember</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter II - Rubble without a Cause</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter III - Once Upon a Climb</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter IV - Snow Place Like Home</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Chapter V - The Good Knight</li>\n<li>King's Quest: Epilogue</li>\n</ul>\nFor the PlayStation versions each chapter can be purchased separately, with the first one acting as the base game. For the Xbox and PC versions the first chapter is available separately, but the remaining ones are bought through King's Quest: Season Pass. All platforms support the first chapter + season pass as well as this complete collection with five chapters at once, except for the Xbox 360 that does not offer a complete collection.",

      "description": "<i>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</i> is a first-person adventure game set in the fictional Yaughton Valley in the British Shropshire countryside. The game starts on 6th June 1984 at the moment the world ends. It is set in an open world environment and has a non-linear story told through six characters (Frank, Jeremy, Kate, Lizzie, Stephen, Wendy) tied to specific landmarks. The protagonist is not defined, but can move around freely in the environment including a main village, woods and many other buildings. There are five main areas to the game and the focus is on unraveling the story, getting to know the characters and their relationships, and piecing together the information  to form a coherent narrative.\n\nThe entire environment is abandoned and devoid of life. Information is gathered through observation, reading notes, listening to recordings etc. At certain points swirls of golden lights appear that can be tuned like a radio using the controller's gyroscope function. By making the light brighter conversations and interactions from the past are triggered, but only through audio. Some of these lights also guide the protagonist in a certain direction. There is no HUD, inventory or puzzle-solving. No pointers are provided for noticing certain clues or reaching certain goals. Interaction is available in various ways, from manipulating items in the environment to opening doors.",

      "description": "<i>Mad Max</i> is a third-person action and vehicular combat game set in an open world environment. It is based on the <i>Mad Max</i> movie series and was released following the 2015 movie <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. It uses many elements from the films, but has its own storyline not based on the movies. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, barren wasteland and combines sections on foot with vehicular action. The entire game world is available right away and the player can pursue the main quest, side missions or explore freely. Some game elements are inspired by the Just Cause series by the same developer. The protagonist is Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) and he is on his way to the Plains of Silence. In the beginning of the game his car, the Interceptor, is stolen. Bandits known as War Boys, led by Scabrous Scrotus (the son of Immortan Joe from <i>Fury Road</i>), leave him behind in the desert without his car, weapons or supplies. Max wants to find back his vehicle, take vengeance on  Scrotus and build Magnum Opus, the perfect car.\n\nA large part of the game is spent driving as Max teams up with the mechanic Chumbucket who rides along. Max has a dog as a companion and gets to build a new car to become the Magnum Opus. Various upgrades become available during the course of the game by spending scrap, the main game currency, next to fuel to keep driving. Others are provided by collecting car parts of enemies or by hijacking cars. Next to guns, car weapons include a flamethrower, a grappling hook, a mounted cannon etc.. While racing a slow-motion function is be activated to provide assist while aiming. Chumbucket repairs the car automatically. There is a large amount of customization that affects the driving (chassis, wheels, engine, handling, nitro, suspension) as well as combat, with spikes to protect against boarding, armour, ramming grills, explosive harpoons, and aesthetic options such as new car bodies and paint jobs. Certain sections are not accessible by car and require Max to climb and travel on foot with ranged weapons and melee combat based on attacking and forming combos, blocking and dodging. Markers above the enemies' heads announce actions and the fighting system is similar to the Batman: Arkham games. Health is replenished by eating small animals.\n\nThere is a leveling system for Max and tokens earned through challenges can be exchanged for perks. A mysterious stranger called Gryffa also often reveals slices of Max' past. The world is divided into different territories where the enemy threat can be lowered by completing missions such as clearing minefields, taking out snipers, tearing down scarecrows, attacking convoys and invading camps. Camps offer many approaches to get inside and clear them with both blunt action and stealth. There are other activities such as racing and time trials or collecting history relics. Sometimes devastating sandstorms occur, rewarding adventurous players with large amounts of scrap for venturing outside. Hot air balloons can be located to use them for fast travel. There is a day-and-night cycle, environmental hazards and a border to the game world that is not clearly defined, leading into The Big Nothing where Max can attempt to survive as long as possible. A territory is cleared entirely by defeating a boss in an enemy stronghold. It is also possible to visit friendly strongholds that provide quests and rewards for bringing down the enemy activity in the region.",

      "description": "<i>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</i> is a multiplayer game about defusing bombs. It is the commercial version of a prototype originally created for a 2014 Game Jam. Only one player plays the game on the screen. The other player, or more players, are not allowed to see the screen and only read a bomb defusing manual freely available at bombmanual.com. It can be read online or printed out. They are the experts who can help to solve it, but they cannot see or touch the bomb. The player controlling the game is inside a room and views a briefcase that contains a bomb from a first-person perspective. It contains different modules based on coloured wires, words, dials, maze patterns etc. that all need to be solved before time runs out to defuse the bomb. The briefcase can be rotated freely and the game player can manipulate parts of the modules. There is a timer on the bomb showing the remaining time.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the patterns and the many variables, the player viewing the bomb cannot solve the modules and needs to relay the visual elements to the other players so they can consult the manual and tell what to do. The gameplay thus relies on efficient communication and feedback, either online using a voice chat service or as a local multiplayer game with the other players in the same room. Bombs are procedurally generated so they are never identical. There are however different difficulty levels for the bombs based on the amount of mistakes (strikes), the time limit and the amount and complexity of the modules. Each module has a light in the top right corner and once solved it turns green.\n\nInitially released with one version of the manual, there are meant to be multiple ones and when starting the game the correct manual needs to be verified in-game through a code. The game supports VR for the game player through Oculus Rift or Gear VR.",

      "description": "The Swedish game studio Frictional Games continues its tradition in the horror genre (Amnesia, Penumbra series) with <i>SOMA</i>. This time, the player is presented with a science fiction story in which the protagonist, Simon Jarret, is suddenly transported to an abandoned facility the moment he goes through a brain scan. After surviving a car accident with severe brain injuries as a result, Simon accepts to have his brain scanned with a new, experimental technology. While he starts the day in his apartment in Toronto, the scan takes him to the mysterious PATHOS-II facility mere hours later.\n\nMuch like its predecessors, <i>SOMA's</i> gameplay is built from monster encounters, puzzle solving and the exploration of mysterious game world and plot. Similar to <i>Amnesia</i> or the last two <i>Penumbra</i> games, Simon in unarmed and every encounter requires the player to avoid direct contact with the hostile creatures of PATHOS-II. As for the puzzles, Frictional reuses in part the capabilities of its in-house engine, the HPL engine (on its third main version), to manipulate every object in the world as if the mouse were a virtual hand that the player inserts in the game world. However, this time around puzzles are mainly about interacting with computer terminals, leaving object manipulation more for world exploration.",

      "description": "<i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth and the final game in the <i>Metal Gear</i> series. Canonically it is the fifth game in the series, but it is the eleventh main installment overall. It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The gameplay borrows and expands upon most of the mechanics introduced in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>, which was a smaller slice in content in anticipation of this title. The game is set in 1984 with Big Boss also known as Punished \"Venom\" Snake as the protagonist. It takes place in Afghanistan and the border between Angola and Zaire as Big Boss seeks revenge against the Cipher group led by Skull Face who destroyed his forces and almost killed him in <i>Ground Zeroes</i>. At the start of the game he wakes up in a military hospital in Cyprus and is almost immediately attacked by soldiers and a strange, burning creature. Eventually he is rescued by Ocelot, he locates Kaz Miller and the trio then establishes a base to hunt down Cipher and its covert strike force XOF with commander Skull Face.\n\nThe game has a complex story with the typical long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in <i>Ground Zeroes</i> are carried over. It is still an action game and stealth oriented, but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. <i>Ground Zeroes</i> only offered a single environment, while this game has many and brings back the base building feature from Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. To access advanced tools and weapons, Big Boss needs to complete missions for Miller so he can expand the main Mother Base. The player needs to focus on a consistent flow of the GMP currency to manage the base, research new technologies, hire soldiers and use money during missions for instance to call in an air strike. Next to merely completing missions, a Fulton technology can be used to transport back items, weapons, vehicles and even soldiers with interesting abilities to the Mother Base to use them. Soldiers can be assigned to different teams for combat, research or gathering intel. Eventually they can be sent out to complete missions on their own, providing additional GMP. A companion app on a real smartphone can be used to manage the base as well.\n\nThe game world has a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound, for instance with rain and sandstorms. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map. There are large distances to travel with different vehicles. Big Boss can travel on foot, on horseback or use a plane, a motorcycle, a patrol vehicle, a tank or a helicopter. Missions can be played entirely as an action game, but a large amount of mechanics and rewards are based around stealth. He can run, sneak and crawl along with scouting enemy patterns. It is possible to render guards unconscious, kill them or use sound to lure some in a certain direction. Enemies have various alert statuses and will investigate or trigger alarms when they are suspicious or find bodies or destroyed security cameras, changing their patrol routes. There are many entry points going underground, through gates or finding an entry by climbing. Optionally it is possible to take out enemies from far using a sniper rifle or by smuggling an explosive device into the base to blow it up.\n\nWith each new technology new options become available, introducing drones, special types of weapon enhancements, a taser, echolocation and so on. Many types of buddies are provided over time, accompanying Big Boss, with various upgrade options. Initially there is his horse D-Horse, but later on also the wolf pup D-Dog, the female sniper Quiet, and the mobile weapons platform D-Walker. Next to the main missions there are several boss battles against powerful characters. A multiplayer mode allows players to build a second Mother Base, called the Forward Operating Base. It complements the main single-player game to gather resources and expand it, but it can be attacked by other players who will try to steal resources. Players defend their own base and can attack others. This can happen in the middle of a story mission and it is possible to quickly call in friends to help with the defense. This part of the game has microtransactions with real money to speed up certain elements. In October 2015 the console versions were updated with a second multiplayer mode as a successor to Metal Gear Online. There are several game modes where players or team of players fight each other. It has a safe hub inspired by the single-player Africa map, but expanded, where all weapons and abilities can be tested with unlimited ammo before accessing a lobby to play the game.",

      "description": "<i>Black Ops III</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Black Ops</i> subseries (including World at War) of the <i>Call of Duty</i> first-person shooter franchise and the twelfth main title overall. It is the follow-up to Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but not a direct sequel. Rather, it continues the time progression of battles in the past in the first <i>Black Ops</i> game, modern and near future combat in the second game, and now a game in a far dystopian future set in 2065, 40 years after the previous title. A first for the series, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions do not have the main single-player campaign, only the multiplayer portion and additional game modes such as Zombies. The single-player campaign is substantially longer compared to the previous games.\n\nThe game is set in the same universe as <i>Black Ops II</i> and references some past events indirectly. For instance, the focus in the story is back on group troops following the aftermath of the drone strikes by Menendez in the second game. Set in the far future, soldiers are now equipped with DNI, the Direct Neural Interface. It allows them to communicate directly with computers and machines, and it can also be used to read the thoughts and memories of people. The player controls a male or female character and needs the DNI after a failed infiltration and hostage rescue mission from the NCR in Egypt. Your partner, Jacob Hendricks, undergoes the enhancements as well. Five years later the player character and Hendricks are under the command of CIA Agent Rachel Kane investigating a CIA black site in Singapore. Through a series of events the player ends up in Egypt and Switzerland. The story deals with an artificial intelligence called Corvus, the role of privacy, the effects of cybernetic enhancements, secret CIA experiments, and also the characters Commander John Taylor and Dr. Yousef Salim.\n\nMissions include linear first-person shooter levels with free movement as well as sections played shooting from a stationary position such as a vehicle. As the game is set in the future, various futuristic technologies are available. By progressing through the game new weapons and gadgets are unlocked. The most important ones are the new abilities called Cyber Cores and Cyber Rigs. Cores provide new abilities and attacks, while Rigs influence movement and agility, opening up powerslides, wallruns and boosted jumps. There are three types of Cores and only one can be equipped per loadout. They enable the player character to distract with decoy drones, boost the character in strength or speed, attack or take over robots or keep opponents occupied with swarms of bees. The campaign can be played cooperatively with up to four players.\n\nThe same abilities return for multiplayer, but there they are mostly enabled by default and the loadout centers more on the selection of weapons, items and the enhancements for weapons. The different types of killstreaks typical for the series return. Movement is very different and faster compared to earlier titles through wallruns and boosted jumps using thruster packs. This time multiplayer games are not played with a nameless soldier, but by choosing a specific Specialist, represented by a specific class. They each have a callsign, a distinct look, a unique weapon and a unique ability. Four are available right away and the other ones are unlocked gradually. The Specialist classes available at the launch include Battery, Nomad, Outrider, Prophet, Reaper, Ruin, Seraph, Spectre. Ruin for instance has access to Gravity Spikes as a special weapon and Overdrive with enhanced speed as an ability. In certain matches players can vote to protect (keep) or ban certain Specialists, weapons and abilities. The Pick Ten system for custom loadouts from the previous game is still present. Guns can be customized through the Gunsmith feature, for both form and function.\n\nUnlock tokens are a new element. They are needed to unlock new weapons, attachments, equipment and killstreak awards. They are earned by completing challenges and leveling up. Another type of tokens is used to trade at a Black Market to receive packages with a selection of common or rare items. Many game modes return, such as Domination, Gun Game, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, Search & Destroy and Uplink. There are no new player-versus-player multiplayer game modes. Typical for the <i>Black Ops</i> series is the Zombies game mode with separate storylines. This time it includes an experience system, and special abilities and power-ups can be selected in the loadout. These power-ups can be bought at the Zombies version of the Black Market or through a chewing gum machine. Also new for that mode is the use of altars that temporarily turn the player character into a powerful creature. Levels contain short-cuts that can only be accessed while in creature form. The Zombies mode is now set in Morg City and introduces four new characters: Nero the Magician, Jessica the Femme Fatale, Vincent the Cop and Campbell the Boxer.\n\nAnother new game mode is Freerun where players can run through obstacle courses using the new abilities to get the fastest times. When the regular campaign is finished, the Nightmare campaign is unlocked. It remixes the original campaign with different enemies such as zombies, random weapons instead of loadouts, and the use of power-ups.",
