      "description": "<i>Moon Patrol</i> is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate \"stage\" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. \n\nDangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. \n\nAfter completing the first course (the \"Beginner Course\") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course.

      "description": "The seventh installment of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series takes place in a post-modern, steampunk, sci-fi world where high technology reigns and where robots and bio-engineered mutants co-exist with humans and dragons.\n\nThe story focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world's high technology. Shinra supports this technology with Mako Energy, Shinra's patented source of power. Unfortunately Mako is the lifeblood of the living planet and by using it up Shinra is slowly upsetting the balance of nature.\n\nIn comes AVALANCHE, a rebel group of disenfranchised citizens who have taken it upon themselves to oppose Shinra's ambitions. The main character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst-ridden fellow with a complex history that is explained as the game goes on. Cloud joins up with AVALANCHE as a mercenary for hire, and together they take on Shinra's maniacal executives and their army of shock-troops, robots, and mutants. However, after a while it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra, but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world.\n\nLike its predecessors, <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> is a role-playing game in Japanese style, featuring turn-based combat with a real-time (ATB, \"active time battle\") element against randomly appearing enemies. Customization in the game revolves around a so-called \"Materia\" system. Instead of magic spells, abilities, and bonus stats being saved to a single character, they are saved to Materia orbs, allowing the player to change a character's spells and abilities from the equipment menu at any time. Materia orbs can be bought in stores or found during exploration. The series' trademark summoned monsters are also contained within specific Materia. Beside experience points, characters also receive ability points that gradually upgrade the abilities of the currently equipped Materia.\n\nEach character also possesses a set of unique attacks called \"Limit Breaks\". By sustaining enough damage without dying a character will build up their Limit Gauge, which can be expended to do a highly damaging attack when filled. More powerful Limit Breaks are unlocked as previous ones are used, and acquiring the most powerful Limit Break of each character will require completion of sub-quests. \n\nThe game utilizes 3D character models and pre-rendered backgrounds with varying camera angles for exploration of towns and hostile areas. World map navigation and battle screens are done completely in 3D. CG movies are frequently used as cutscenes that advance the game's story. The game features a large amount of mini-games (most of which are optional) and many ways to explore the game world, as the player gradually acquires various vehicles that can venture into previously inaccessible locations.",

      "description": "The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by \"Eos\". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive \"Red Faction\". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and its workers, any little incident could ignite...\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> is a first-person shooter. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in a less protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most of which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.\n\n<i>Red Faction</i> features a game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths,  tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.",

Here's what LucasArts says about it:\r\n\r\nIt has been eight years since the first spectacular Podracing showdown between Sebulba and the young Anakin Skywalker. Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot. Thus the stage is set for Star Wars\u00ae Racer Revenge\u2019, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good. \r\nGet down and dirty against 16+ of the most aggressive Podracers in the galaxy and smash your opponents into twisted wreckage\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel the heat and roar of a horde of opponents on your tail--the turbo-charged Podracer AI means you're never on the track alone\r\n\r\n\r\nNew, never-before-seen characters and Podracers, plus a few of your old favorites\r\n\r\n\r\nRace to the finish in the Boonta Eve Classic or earn your place in the winner's circle on 13 devilishly challenging courses on four new planets, plus Tatooine\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple game modes include practice, single play, tournament, time trials and versus\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Rainbow Studios, makers of the hit games Motocross Madness and ATV Off-Road Fury \r\n",

The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.\n\nMost of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.\n\nSome of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.\n\nThe PlayStation ports of the SNES version have updated controller and display options, leaderboards, new save options, and Trophies.",

There Daxter accidentally falls into a pool of evil Dark Eco, and transforms into a weasel-like creature. Bringing Daxter to his original human form is enough of a problem, and now the Lurkers are using this Dark Eco for their own malign intentions. The plot goes on as the game plays.\n\nOur hero(es) can jump, double-jump, spin-kick, uppercut, hang onto things, and ride various vehicles and an occasional creature along the way to complete their assigned tasks. There are also several NPCs to interact with and play their side quests and mini-games. ",

Chosen to be the blue-print for the Clone Army, Jango must now prove himself in order to gain the biggest job on the streets, wiping out the deadly cult, Bando Gora. Every other bounty hunter in the galaxy is willing and able to do the job, so you must work hard to gain the contract from Darth Tyranus.\n\nTo win the contract, you must complete a range of missions and collect the bounties on worlds very familiar to Star Wars fans. Jango has his trusty dual pistols to help him out, but also has the ability to use his flame thrower, jet pack, poison darts and much more.  Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level.  Jango must identify them with his helmet gear, and catch them alive...or dead.  Bounties allow the player to unlock bonus materials.\n\nThe 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs.  Bounty Hunter also connects to the movies in that it explains how Jango became the model for the Clone Army of the Republic, and how he became acquainted with Zam Wesell, who makes an appearance in the movies.",

Every third level is a \"challenge stage\" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.\n\nCertain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last \"life,\" you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.\n\nA summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final \"hit ratio\"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.",

After completing their quest from the original title, Jak and Daxter are shot into another time and space and the future of their planet, and everything is different. The two are split up, with Jak thrown into jail by Baron Praxis, the ruler of Haven City. For two years Jak is experimented on with dark Eco, turning him into an almost Hulk-like character, mean and filled with rage. \n\nRescued by Daxter, the two must set off and find a way to shut down the operation and get revenge for Jak's uncontrollable change. Along the way they will meet new friends and deadly enemies (known as Metal Heads), but at least now Jak has something special on his side: weapons, and lots of them. Including a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon. Gameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights).",

      "description": "Argus is a standard vertical shooting game like Raptor: Call of the Shadows or Tyrian; this game bears a strong resemblance to Terra Cresta, an arcade game.  There is no story, this game is a straight arcade-action shooter.\n\nThe game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship.  Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.\n",

However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.\n\nMag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature. ",

One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.\n\nGameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights). Weapons including the shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon from the previous game as well as two upgrades for each weapon. The upgrades become available after making progress in the game and at the end the player can freely switch between these twelve weapons.",

Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.\r\n\r\nHowever, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn <i>2020 Super Baseball</i> is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.\r\n",

      "description": "At a summer camp for up-and-coming psychics, a young boy with an unusually high level of psychic ability inexplicably shows up. The boy, named Raz, is allowed to stay at the camp until his father comes to pick him up, but his arrival coincides with very strange circumstances. Soon, evidence that someone is psychically tampering with the campers' minds reveals itself, and Raz is the only one who can stop it. Raz must project himself into the psyches of several different people in order to figure out what is going on and who is behind the recent occurrences.\n\n<i>Psychonauts</i> is a 3D platform game with a rather unorthodox style. The characters' inner worlds are the game's levels. Each world reflects the personality of the person whose psyche it represents, often resulting in unique, surreal creations, and influencing the gameplay style. For example, the psyche of a giant lungfish is presented as a large city populated by fish people, in which Raz himself becomes a giant monster who can destroy entire buildings; the psyche of a mental patient is a huge board game, where Raz has to command armies in order to defeat Napoleon, etc.\n\nThere are also many gameplay elements and tasks which are common for all the levels. These include Raz fighting the (not very numerous) regular enemies, defeating level bosses, collecting currency, \"figments of imagination\" needed to upgrade his powers, and bonus items such as complete sets of the character's memories and others. Many of the game's puzzles require the usage of psychic powers, which Raz obtains in a more or less strict order. These powers range from combat abilities such as Psy Shield to Telekinesis (moving objects without touching them) and Clairvoyance (reading other people's minds). \n\nThe camp itself serves as the game's \"hub\", in which the player can explore, interact with characters, search for secret areas and items, and so on.",

      "description": "Greetings earthlings! I, Cryptosporidium 137 of the Furon Empire, happened upon your planet on the way back from destroying the martians. Due to some experiments with atomic weaponry, we lack genitalia and the quality of our clones has degraded. Since you pathetic humans all carry Furon DNA in your genetic code, I have been instructed to collect fresh samples. Survival is not an option, but you should be honoured to support the legacy of the Furon Empire!\r\n\r\n<i>Destroy All Humans!</i> is a humorous action game with winks to the era of the goofy fifties' sci-fi movies. Crypto can hypnotize and scan people, and lift objects using psychokinesis. He can also control humans using the Hypno Blast to impose his commands. Extracted DNA can be exchanged in your mothership for new weapons and ability upgrades. Furon weaponry includes a Zap-o-Matic, disintegrator ray, abducto beam, quantum deconstructor and even the famous anal probe. Not to be overpowered, you have to disguise yourself using the Holobob. There are different alert levels, similar to the Grand Theft Auto games and if you are not careful, you will be hunted down by the police, military or the government.\r\n\r\nYou are constantly in contact with the mothership, where you can purchase upgrades, save the game and apply for new missions. Crypto does not have to run all the time, he can also use his flying saucer to abduct humans or animals, cause havoc or face bigger threats. Next to the story-based missions, you will also be instructed to collect specific samples or kill a certain amount of humans in a race against time.",

      "description": "January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.\n\n<i>Indigo Prophecy</i> (<i>Fahrenheit</i> in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.\n\nThe game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.\n\nCinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.",

Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.\n\nWhen Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it <i>Darius Plus</i>.\n\nThe plot of <i>Darius</i> involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.\n\nWhat sets <i>Darius</i> apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.\nApart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned <i>R-Type's</i> and <i>Gradius'</i>.",

Survival is quick and dirty slaughter. In campaign mode, the player will travel through different areas of the base; restoring power, destroying alien entry sites, and picking up cash to buy weapons, ammunition, implants that raise attributes, body armor and various gadgets at the mid-level shop. The aliens are at first simple grunts which have only one tactic which is to rush the player character; however, later on, most are equipped with weaponry and are much more numerous. The game sometimes has hundreds of aliens swarming the character at the same time.\n\nThe color of blood can be changed between red and green, as well as locked with a password.",

Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.\n\nSome heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. \n\nYou explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. \n\nBoss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.\n\nThe game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.",

Instead of only localizing the game, developer Level-5 Inc. spent 2 years to improve the game and add new features and content. This version was also re-released in Japan as <i>Rogue Galaxy (Director's Cut)</i>.\n\nThe original single-layer DVD was replaced by dual-layer and the doubled amount of space was used for smoother, better-looking graphics and additional data. Aside from the 4 existing planets, a fifth one, Alistia, was added. It is not part of the main story, but deepens the storyline and has new quests and items. A key to access the new world can be found in chapter 8. The existing Insectron Tournament sidequest has been expanded with two species of Insectrons, each with 8 types of Insectrons per species. The level design of Rosencaster Prison, the Gladius Towers, the Daytron factory, Rosa's desert town, and Rosa's Labyrinth has also been altered.\n\nOver 2,000 lines of additional voice dialogue were added, the battle animations were reworked, damaging enemies has become easier (attack formula revision) and Toady's analysis of weapons has also been simplified.\n\nOther gameplay improvements include the introduction of collectible Burning Chips, which power the Burning Strike attack, more items overall, two new weapons for each character (except Jaster), with 140 weapons in total, and 5 bonus costumes for each character (6 for Kisala and Simon).",

This time, this system is enhanced with the option of choosing between four different power-up sequences, allowing the player to use different types of weapons against enemies. There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows the player-controlled spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While the player only could have two of them in the NES version of <i>Gradius</i>, it is now possible in all versions to have up to four.",

There are 100 levels of alien armada to get through. Your adventures will take from from the Earth to the Moon and finally to Titan via other stops in between.\n\n\nPower-ups are available through simple pick-up from bonus ships you shoot down which will give you temporary weapon upgrades or point collecting upgrades. The points you collect on each level can be used between levels to purchase upgrades to your weaponry and armour. Your shields will also need to be replenished between levels if you are shot, while other upgrades you purchase become permanent components.\n\n\nEnemy ships for the most part move in set patterns excepting the five mother-ships which move in a more aggressive pattern of their own choosing. Points are rewarded for efficiency in shooting enemies and for capturing enemy aliens who may parachute down off their crashing ship. Bonus rounds in between some levels allow the player to earn upgrades and points while an online high-score table allows the player to boast his/her scores online.",

The drone represents jet fighter (behind view) and helicopter gunship (top-down view). It may be moved on the screen, fire air-to-air and air-to-ground guns and pow bomb. Limitless hordes of mechanoid invaders, whose sole intent is the total domination of the Earth, will try to stop you. Exit from each level is guarded by the powerful boss, who you should eliminate.\n\nThere are two versions of the arcade version (<i>Typhoon</i> in Europe and <i>Ajax</i> in Japan) which only differ in the order of the eight stages. The DOS and Sharp versions are based on <i>Ajax</i> while the Commodore 64, CPC (five levels) and ZX Spectrum (six levels) versions are based on <i>Typhoon</i>. The PlayStation 4 version includes both arcade versions.",

Classic mode plays like regular <i>R-Type</i>, with a limited set of lives and re-spawn at a certain checkpoint within the level. Unlimited however gives the player an unlimited amount of lives, and re-spawn is instantaneous. In this mode, the player can compete to finish the game with as little extra lives as possible. Finishing games in Unlimited Mode also unlocks the stages for play in Classic Mode.\n\n<i>R-Type Dimensions</i> also benefits from Xbox Live enhancements such as leaderboards and online co-operative mode.",

      "description": "Alex Mercer has a problem or a gift - depending on the view. Thanks to a virus in his system he has several deadly powers and can change his appearance into any person he consumes which basically means the same thing as brutally killing the person he wants to be. Of course Alex didn't voluntarily get this \"enhancement\". Instead he was part of a genetic experiment at a company called Gentek. Having lost his memory about what exactly happened, he is now both looking for vengeance as well as his past. The second specimen, Elizabeth Green, on the other hand meanwhile infects more and more parts of Manhattan Island with a transmutation of the virus which converts people either into mindless zombies or brutal monsters.\n\n<i>Prototype</i> is an open-world game similar to Grand Theft Auto IV where the player controls Alex through a 3rd-person-view. He is able to freely roam about Manhattan Island with iconic scenery like Central Park and Times Square. But instead of stealing cars and mugging old ladies, Alex feels more like going the Spider-Man route. By sprinting against a wall, he is able to climb and jump up to the roof fast. Thanks to his supernatural jump ability and his invulnerability to falling damage, he can then traverse the city from above instead of making his way through rush hour. Of course monsters like hunters as well as the military have the means to reach him even up there. To defend himself, Alex has several powers at his disposal. He can lift heavy objects and throw them at enemies, making it easy to take down even a full-blown helicopter. He also has the already mentioned ability to shape shift into any person he manages to grab and consume. When done without being seen, it removes the heat from Alex and will, just as hiding does, eventually put his human pursuers back to sleep. The monsters on the other hand will keep at him. It also enables him to enter areas he couldn\u2019t access before. Other powers include claws, a shield, fists like boulders that make for a good punch and powerful lash. At any time Alex can only use one of those powers and he has to unlock them first. This is done by investing the evolution points he gains for killing enemies and fulfilling objectives into upgrades.\n\nDivided into several categories, these upgrades increase for example his sprint speed, give him new abilities like said powers or enable him to do new moves like gliding through the air instead of just falling straight down. In addition some abilities like driving a tank or improving his ability to handle normal weapons can only be learned by consuming specific persons marked with a symbol over their head. This is also necessary to replenish his health and to uncover the Web of Intrigue. The Web of Intrigue fills in the blanks on Alex\u2019s background and what happened to him at Gentek. Some pedestrians, military personal or police had more or less direct contact with Alex or the project he was part on and if he finds and consumes them, a short cutscene shows what he learns from that person. To keep an overview of his progress, the player can access a detailed map from the menu. There he can not only rewatch every movie but can also see what information connects with others, giving the player an understanding how every piece of the puzzle is connected.\n\nIf the player isn\u2019t doing the missions of the main storyline or destroying military bases or hives, he can find several different kinds of mini-games in the city. Ranging from kill/consume missions and waypoint races over the roof tops to fighting small skirmishes on either the side of the military or the infected. In any case the player gains additional evolution points depending how well he did. These mini-games are unlocked by progressing through the story line as well as by getting a gold medal in a mini-game. Another past-time that grants evolution points is the search for landmarks and hints hidden around the island. The more the player collects of these, the more evolution points he gets for it.",

      "description": "<i>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</i> continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series. It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.\n\nThere are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Certain combinations, like the X-Men or Fantastic Four, will give you a bonus which varies by team. If you have fewer than four players. You may switch characters at any time. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.\n\nDefeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also health icons to pick up. You can carry two of these at a time. Each icon can be used to instantly fully heal a character or to revive one that has been knocked out. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.\n\nYou start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by playing through the game or performing specific accomplishments. Each character has a second costume to unlock. What you do to unlock it varies by character.\n\nThroughout the game, you will have conversations with various NPCs. Some of them react differently to specific characters. At various points, you can choose an aggressive, diplomatic or defensive reaction. By answering a specific way enough times, you can unlock boosts.\n\nThe big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. You fill a fusion meter by defeating enemies and are allowed to have to two fusions at a time. Any two characters have a unique fusion. These come in three basic types: There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. You target with the left stick while mashing a button to build up power. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. You mash a button to increase this radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies. You mash a button to speed them up. All fusions have a \"high score.\" This is a target number of enemies to defeat. If you do this, you get a health token.",

      "description": "<i>Machinarium</i> is a point-and-click adventure set in a mechanical world where the player controls a small robot that has been kicked out of the city. He has to return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.\n\nIt is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen, but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the same time.",

      "description": "<i>VVVVVV</i> is a platformer brought back to the aesthetics of those in the eighties, with a basic colour palette and a limited set of controls. Players command Veridian, whose space ship hits an interference and is about to crash. The entire crew is evacuated quickly, but a few crew members remain. Due to a teleporter malfunction they have been be moved to random locations on the ship. It is up to Veridian to restore all teleporters and find back the five missing crew members: Violet, Vitellary, Vermillion, Verdigris and Victoria ... hence the game's title.\n\nThe game is entirely built around a gravity-flip mechanism. Next to moving around, the only other main ability Veridian has, is to flip gravity force 180 degrees, enabling him to switch between moving on the ground and upside-down on the ceiling. Most of the areas feature a combination of spikes, platforms and different moving objects and enemies that require a quick succession of movement and gravity flipping, demanding quick timing from the player.\n\nThe path to explore the space station is not linear. Any of the crew members can be tracked down right away and difficult sections can be abandoned to explore later. Once different teleporters have been found, Veridian can quickly move between faraway sections of the space station using a map. The game requires a lot of trial and error to progress, but it offers an unlimited amount of continues and regular checkpoints.\n\nNext to the main objective there are also 20 hidden trinkets to collect, which open up new game modes. These include time trials, intermissions, a game mode where the game needs to be played without dying once, a flip mode where the entire game is flipped vertically, and a secret laboratory.\n\nLater levels introduce new difficulties such as looping screens, beams that bounce the main character around, moving screens with spikes at the sides, sequences where Veridian needs to survive in a closed section of the level, and a part where another character needs to be guided around with indirect control over his movement. There are also terminals that provide information, logs and activate events. Each room also has a unique name and there is a soundtrack of chiptune music.\n\nThe later released 3DS version has 18 user-created levels, but the level editor is not included for the handheld release. There are however 3D effects and some music is reinterpreted.",

      "description": "<i>Star Trek Online</i> is a MMORPG set in the Star Trek universe. The game takes place 30 years after the events in the movie <i>Star Trek: Nemesis</i> (2002) and builds upon the destruction of the Romulan homeworld Romulus portrayed at the beginning of <i>Star Trek</i> (2009). With the Romulans being crippled and even at the point of extinction, the Klingons seize the opportunity in 2382 and start conquering the Romulan sector, leading to a strained relationship with the Federation. In 2399 the band snaps and the Khitomer Accords, the sole reason for 106 years of peace, are broken. Now the current game date is 2409 and war rages in the Alpha Quadrant with the Federation fighting against the Klingons, an again-strong Dominion, the Borg and several other enemies.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player creates a Federation character and can choose from nine different races including Trill, Andorian and Vulcan. The ability to create a member of the Klingon Empire like a Gorn or an Orion becomes only available after reaching level 6 (of 50) as a member of the Federation. This limitation takes into consideration that the Klingon Empire is focused on Player-vs-Player-Combat either against themselves or members of the Federation in combat-arenas or in space with only a handful of quests being available to Klingon players. Besides that difference, the gameplay remains the same on both sides.\n\nThe game is divided into two parts: Space and Land. Right from the start of the game, the player has full control over his own star-ship from a 3rd-person point-of-view allowing him to traverse the space between the sectors and the star-systems on a tactical map as well as take part in full-blown space battles. The player always directly controls the movement of his ship and has full control over its speed, weapons, shields and energy-allocation making the battles very tactical, although not as complex as in the Star Trek: Starfleet Command series. In addition the player has access to special abilities depending on which of the three classes (science, engineering or tactical officer) the player chose for his character. He can also employ help from up to three bridge officers who themselves have special talents.\n\nNPC bridge officers also beam down with the player to planets, stations and such if he's not in a team with other human players. Land battles are fought in real-time (again from a 3rd-person perspective) but are more stationary and play more like combat in other MMOs than the space battles. Although flanking an opponent gives a bonus to damage, using abilities is the main way to success and experience points. Each enemy whether killed in space or on the ground grants experience points and advances both the player and his bridge officers in rank (which function as levels). This way the player and his officers earn skill points to be distributed among the several different skill trees, unlocking new abilities for both ground and space or improving existing ones. \n\nThe player always has full control over his bridge officers. He alone decides their armor and weaponry, which skills they level up and if they are worthy to be promoted to a new rank. This is also the case for his ship which he can outfit with better gear, change the appearance of or replace with a completely new one once he's reached specific ranks and unlocked access to new ship classes.\n\nEach star system in the game is its own instance while the overall tactical map is hosted on one server. Once a player enters a system, he'll automatically join other players already there and be brought up to speed regarding the current status of their quest (if there is one). Once the objectives - usually a combination of space and ground battles - are completed, the players return to the tactical map and can get their reward right away through the use of the communicator instead of flying back to the quest-giver. Typically new quests are also obtained this way.",

Recognized by his unique habit of leaving an origami figure at the center of his crimes, the serial killer has taken another victim. With his pattern of killing his victims within four days time is running out to save him. This is where the lives of four characters become entangled as they all search to stop the Origami Killer: Ethan Mars, a former architect overcome with depression and guilt over an accident leading to one of his son's death; Norman Jayden, an FBI profiler investigating the Origami case using an experimental device known as ARI (Added Reality Interface); Madison Paige, a nightmare filled journalist who unexpectedly finds her way into the investigation; and Scott Shelby, a private eye hired by families of victims of the serial killer to find things the authorities may have missed.\n\n<i>Heavy Rain</i> is an interactive drama title combining adventure and action elements. The story revolves around the lives of four characters as they try to stop the Origami Killer from taking the life of another victim. The game has a heavy emphasis on user choices, with different decisions you make completely changing the way the story unfolds and which will lead to one of the many possible endings the game offers. There is no game-over screen if one of or all of the main characters die, there will just be a different ending given. \n\nSimilar to Quantic Dream's previous title Indigo Prophecy/Fahrenheit, the game is moved along primarily by the use of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Movement of your character is done by holding the R2 button and choosing a direction with the left analog stick. Holding the L2 button brings up your characters thoughts and pressing the button to go along with each thought will lead him/her to say or do something.\n\nBudget re-release of <i>Heavy Rain</i> includes game patch to support PlayStation Move controller (the patch can also be downloaded as standalone for free). That includes budget releases such as Platinum (in Europe), Greatest Hits (in America), or PlayStation 3 the Best (in Asia).",

      "description": "<i>Resonance of Fate</i> is a role-playing game that takes place in the future when the Earth becomes too poisonous to live on and humanity moves to the machine-city of <i>Basel</i>. It is a city built high up to the sky upon a tower-like structure. The story of the game focuses on Vashyron, who is the leader of the PMF (Private Military Firm), as well as two other characters named Zephyr and Leanne, who join Vashyon's group and take on missions from the citizens of Basel. \n\nCombat in Resonance of Fate is done through a unique turn-based system dubbed <i>tri-Attack-Battle (t-A-B)</i>. Movement, charging, and attacks are done using the action gauge until a character's turn is over. However, enemies still attack in real time while the player is performing actions. Before attacking an enemy the player needs to build up their charge, which builds up fast if a character is closer to the enemy. Attacks in battle require at least one full charge to be successful and either deal non-permanent scratch damage with machine guns and rapid fire weapons or permanent direct damage with handguns and grenades. Dealing direct damage also makes scratch damage permanent. Once an attack is completed the character's turn is over, so it is up to the player to use their characters to deal both types of damage timely and effectively against enemies.\n\nSpecial attacks in the game are presented in the form of Hero Actions where a character can be sent down a path shooting multiple times and multiple enemies while invincible to enemy attacks. Hero Actions cost <i>Bezels</i> and once they are depleted the player enters <i>Critical Condition</i> in which they cannot use items and both their attack and accuracy are greatly reduced, however Bezels can be recovered by destroying an enemy's body part or defeating it entirely. Hero Actions can also built up to another type of special attack called a <i>Tri-Attack</i>  where all three characters will attack at once, but it can only be performed once certain conditions are met.",

This game features six stages with over 40 enemy types.\n\nYou can choose between 3 game modes (Novice, Original and Maniac) with different scoring systems. The modes differ, for example, in the set of available techniques. In comparison to the Novice mode, the Original mode features a shield to protect the ship, which can be activated for a short time, and holding the down the spread fire button will also shoot rockets after a few moments. Furthermore, the enemies are colored differently in Novice mode to make them more visible, and you collect golden stars as part of the scoring system. The Maniac mode adds some new ways to get higher scores. For example, the distance between your ship and an enemy influences the score: you get a larger bonus the nearer you are to the enemy ship when you destroy it. Destroying many enemies in short time will also increase the number of awarded points. Last, you can activate a \"Grind Mode\" by focusing your ship's laser beam on a huge enemy. The beam will turn green after a while and then all destroyed enemies will give a higher score.",

In the game the player must fend off contesting Spaniards and indigenous Martian lifeforms in order to regain the favor of the British monarch.\n\nThe player starts with a single ship, but can unlock three more at an in-game shop. Each weapon has a different primary and secondary fire mode and universal \"Vaunt mode\", when Vaunt is activated the ship gains invulnerability through a shield for a couple seconds and then as long as the player keeps the ship's Vaunt meter for fully draining a multiplier for all scores gained.  Money is earned by playing levels, the more points the player receives during a level, the more money is gained. The player can replay levels whenever he or she wants to earn additional money.\n\nTo progress in the story mode the player is at certain points forced to finish previous levels at a certain difficulty to advance. Aside from the story missions there are also 20 challenge missions which reuse enemies and backgrounds from the story missions but have specific challenging goals such as to survive for 5 seconds or gain a certain amount of points.\n\nThe game hovers in between conventional side-scrolling shooters and the \"bullet hell\", alternating between the two styles of play during levels. The game supports local 4 player cooperative multiplayer.",

Well, at least if he has a weapon: at the beginning he is unarmed and can only kick or punch. He has to find pyramids which were dropped by his dead colleagues (also sometimes from killed aliens): those grant an armor, more life energy and a weapon. When the player find even another pyramid, the weapon gets upgraded for a limited amount of time. \n\nHowever, every hit decreases the life energy and if it goes down too far, the armor and weapon are lost. Reaching zero results in death. At the end of every level, the player has to defeat a big boss alien.",

Armors add additional firepower to the ship while equipped, and will be destroyed when shot, saving the ship from one hit. The SYD's primary weapons, a straight ahead laser and falling bombs, can be upgraded from icons dropped by specific enemies. Similarly to Xevious ground targets can only be hit by bombs, while aerial targets can only be hit by lasers.",

      "description": "<i>Blacklight: Retribution</i> is the sequel to Blacklight: Tango Down. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person shooter focused solely on online multiplayer, but this time, it's available under a free-to-play business model. It is set in the same futuristic universe as the first game. Players can compete in various game modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Capture the Flag, Kill Confirmed etc. in private or public online matches.\n\nAlready featured in the first game, the Hyper Reality Visor (HRV) highlights enemies and other important things on your HUD and even let's you see through walls. But it is only usable for a limited amount of time and needs to recharge after use. Additionally, special grenades can disrupt the HRV's use. A level-based ranking system was also retained from the predecessor. Among the new features are Weapon Depots and Hardsuits: The former supply ammunition, heavy weapons and health at the cost of Combat Points (CP), which are earned during gameplay. The latter are heavily armed exoskeletons, which can be controlled by players. They are very hard to destroy using the standard arsenal, but the HRV can reveal weak points. \n\nWeapons and equipment are extensively customizable: There are several basic weapon models called receivers, like  pistol or assault rifle. By adding or changing specific components like barrel, optic sight, magazine or muzzle, players can create their own custom firearms. As an alternative, players may also buy pre-configured weapons (called Premades). Both weapon parts for customization and pre-made guns are obtained at the in-game marketplace, which offers body armor and other items as well. Two in-game currencies can be used: GP and ZEN. GP is slowly earned by playing, whereas ZEN can be bought with real money. So players wanting a certain item can either spend time playing until they gather enough GP, or they may buy ZEN and get the item immediately.",

The authorities have decided to allow the players on the pitch to win by any means including fighting and using weapons to attract the fans back. Eight countries of seven players which include England, Germany, Spain, USA, Japan, Brazil, Korea and Italy compete in a league to be the best in the world. There are now only two stadiums in the world, an astro-turf pitch in Japan and a metallic surface in San Francisco. Instead of the plastic ball used today, the ball is now a metal nuclear powered sphere.\n\n<i>Soccer Brawl</i> is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing a small part of the pitch. The joystick is used to move the players while one fire button passes or heads the ball, the other button punches a player or shoots the ball. The length of time the button is held down determines the power of the shot. Hold it down till the power meter fills and a super shot is initiated knocking down anyone who gets in the way.",

The space and gravity mechanics from Angry Birds: Space are also implemented.\n\nFor this edition the birds have been given a <i>Star Wars</i> character makeover: Red Bird is Luke Skywalker, Yellow Bird is Han Solo, Pink Bird is Princess Leia, Big Red Bird takes the role of Chewbacca, Black Bird becomes Obi Wan Kenobi and Blue Bird is a rebel pilot. In addition to the cosmetic changes, the birds also get specific abilities based on what character they are: Red Bird gets a lightsaber, Yellow Bird gets a blaster etc. The Pigs are cast into the roles of the various bad guys of the <i>Star Wars</i> films such as Jawas, Stormtroopers and Darth Vader.\n\nAs with the characters, each level is based on parts of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, appearing in the order that they do in the film. Each level gets introduced with a <i>Angry Birds</i>-style introduction.",

      "description": "<i>PlanetSide 2</i> is a free-to-play massively multiplayer online first-person shooter that delivers combat on a large scale with up to 2,000 players in a single conflict. It is a re-imagening of the original PlanetSide game. Battles take place with air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of troops. Whether in open fields, tightly packed urban centers or enormous structures, planning, teamwork and communication are essential. The game features continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space. Landmass has intrinsic value as the meta game is about territorial control of a continent split up into different sectors.\n\nThe game has a day-and-night cycle that influences the warfare, and soldiers can sprint, use iron sight and access regenerating shields. By gaining experience (battle rank) additional skills can be unlocked through certification points. There are three factions (Terran Republic, New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty) with classes such as Light Assault, Heavy Assault, Medic, Engineer, Infiltrator and Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit. Players can switch classes and there is an overall skill progression, not tied to a specific class.\n\nThe premium part of the game allows player to purchase convenience items and cosmetic changes with real cash. Optionally a subscription can be purchased for additional advantages.",

The game is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where humans fight against an alien infestation.\n\nIt is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and maintains its core gameplay elements: tactical view, squad screen and battle view. Tactical view is for planning and setting optimal squad path. Squad screen for buying, selling, upgrading or changing order of units. Battle view for directly controlling commander on the battlefield and placing special abilities, like repair that heals units, or aim that focuses squad fire on a single selected tower.\n\nThere are three important additions in <i>Anomaly 2</i>. The first one is the ability to morph units into their second mech form. Mech form grants different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The second addition is the inclusion of new and more sophisticated types of enemies, units and abilities. For example one new tower absorbs squad fire and if its meters is completely full it will transform into a stronger tower. The last one is a multiplayer mode where one player controls the towers and the other one the convoy. That means that one player plays a tower defense game and the other one tower offense.",

      "description": "Battle Worlds: Kronos is a futuristic turn-based strategy game with gameplay similar to the Battle Isle series.\n\nSimilar to other turn-based strategy games like the Battle Isle series or Panzer General the battle ground is partitioned into small hexagons used for movement and attack distance calculation. You can issue two commands to each unit during a round; the possible commands can be determined by two icons on the lower right of a unit: \"Move\" for moving a unit, \"Attack\" for attacking, or \"Joker\" for any of the former or performing a special action (like deploying some artillery units or putting down mines). For example heavy units will have one Attack and one Joker action, making them quite slow, but allowing them to attack twice if they don't have to move. A scouting unit on the other hand would have two joker actions, making it possible to explore and retreat in a single turn.\n\nDamage is calculated by the unit's attack power against that certain type of enemy class and the damage the attacking unit has already taken, so the damage caused by a unit with only a few health points left will also be minimal.  Especially for slow units there a various types of transporters (by land, water or air) which can be used to get your units to the war zone a bit faster. Every time your unit has been involved in a fight the unit will get experience and level up after receiving 5 experience points. The experience can be used to upgrade the unit (e.g. for improved firepower or ignoring movement restrictions) or simply to restore some of the unit's health. Units will defend themselves, but only if their own attack range lies within that of the attacker - making long-range units vulnerable to close-range attacks and vice versa.\n\nEnemy buildings (radar stations, HQs or factories for building and repairing units) can be captured by attacking them with an infantry unit, making infantry units quite important for a mission's success - and making it possible to end a fight early by capturing the enemy HQ. The 3D view can be zoomed from a close up of the units to a strategic map showing only symbols.\n\nThe game features both a singleplayer campaign and multiplayer maps, with multiplayer games saved on a central server for a making turns similar to correspondence chess, i.e. the opponent does not have to be online for your turn. The game may then be resumed at any time, however you may also watch your enemies movements live.",

      "description": "<i>Shadow Fall</i> is set 30 years in the future after the events of Killzone 3.  Helghast refugees who survived the catastrophic event known as \"the Terracide\" have been allowed by the ISA to live with them in a new futuristic city on the planet Vekta.  The two enemies are now separated by a large heavily guarded structure known as the Wall.  Taking control of ISA Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellan, your job to maintain peace between the two rival factions becomes tense as undercover operations to put an end to the war arise.  Armed with an immense hatred toward the Helghast, Kellan will stop at nothing to protect his planet and put an end to the threat, even willing to sacrifice anything to do so.\n\nGameplay in <i>Shadow Fall</i> is fairly similar to previous installments, though now with more improvements.  The game is much more open-ended allowing for multiple ways to reach your target and complete objectives.  The player is accompanied by a companion drone called the OWL which can help you in many different ways including deploying a zip-line or stunning the enemy. Using futuristic weapons and gear allows for new stealth gameplay.  The online multiplayer mode allows for up to 24-players to battle at once on any of the games default 10 maps. The level system is now challenge-based where completing any of the games many challenges will upgrade your rank.  Warzone returns as an online game mode along with Team Deathmatch and Beacon Retrieval (Capture the Flag). A new feature allows for the user to create Warzones with their own specific rules and share them with the community to download and play.",

In the game the player has control over \"The Swapper\", a device that allows the player to create clones of him/herself and take control of them (swapping). All clones respond to movement input, but only the active clone can activate buttons and create new clones. Puzzles consist mostly of trying to move the different clones to the correct position at the right time so that door are opened by the pressure plates they can stand on. Additional difficulty arises from red, blue and purple lamps which block the player from swapping to other clones, creating new clones or both respectively.\n\nThe game takes place on an mostly abandoned space station. Its story unfolds mostly through diary logs and encounters with an NPC. Thematic to the story is cloning in relation to human consciousness and the soul.",

Vella is about to become a human sacrifice for a giant monster. Both are looking for a way to alter their fates.\n\nLike most of the contemporary adventure games, the game employs context-sensitive actions. Most of the puzzles are inventory-based. Players can change between the two characters/plots freely. The game was released in two parts not available separately and the second part was made available at a later date.",

      "description": "<i>inFAMOUS: Second Son</i> takes place seven years after the events of inFAMOUS 2. In this game you play as an entirely new character named Delsin Rowe, a conduit who becomes aware of his powers after a confrontation with an escaped inmate.  When his abilities come under the attention of the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) and their leader Brooke Augustine, Delsin is faced to battle them head on in the streets of Seattle.  As a member of the Akomish Native-American tribe, Delsin knows there is nothing more important than your family. And thus he will do whatever necessary to protect them, even if it means becoming evil to do so.\n\nLike the previous entries in the <i>inFAMOUS</i> series, <i>Second Son</i> is a 3rd-person action game that allows the player to choose between being a good or evil character.  You again play as a conduit, but this time you have access to a much greater variety of powers.  Across your playthrough, Delsin will have the chance to obtain four different powers, the first two being Smoke and Neon. Each power allows for a different playstyle and changes the dynamics of the game.  The Smoke power for instance is more aggressive and used for up-close combat while the Neon power is better situated for long-range, quick movement encounters. The player can unleash a powerful move called Karmic Overload once their karma power is maxed out.  Each of your powers can be upgraded by collecting blast shards all around the map.  Depending on whether you have good or evil karma, the player will be locked out of certain upgrades until there karma becomes the opposite.  Playing through the story gives access to a number of karma decisions where you have to make a good or evil decision usually involving another character, with your choice giving you an increase in that karma. \n\nThe game is open-world and allows movement across the whole city of Seattle.  There are side missions to complete and collectibles to find.  These side missions include spraying anti-D.U.P. images all over the city, finding and killing a secret D.U.P. agent, and searching for hidden audio files scattered around the area. The city is broken up into many D.U.P. controlled districts which can become less occupied by the enemy the more the player completes side quests.  After taking the districts down to 30% controlled by the D.U.P., you gain access to a District Showdown where you face off against a tough enemy opposition and winning that battle removes the D.U.P. from the area and gives access to a fast-travel spot.",

      "description": "<i>Warframe</i> is an online-only third-person action game where the player controls ancient warriors called Tenno in a high-tech, futuristic environment. After centuries they wake up from a cryosleep in a war with the humanoid clones from the Grineer Empire, the Infested who are disfigured creatures affected by the Technocyte virus, and the Corpus, a corporation with robots. To fight back the Tenno are equipped with exo-armour called Warframes. The Tenno is the only playable faction in the game. Another group called Orokin also make an appearance for certain missions. They are soldiers from different factions grouped together. Many of the game elements are derived from the original concept of Dark Sector by the same developer, where they were scrapped before release.\n\nTenno fight with melee weapons (usually a sword) as well as primary and secondary ranged weapons. At the start of the game three different Warframes are available: Excalibur, Loki and Volt. Later on many more become available: Ash, Banshee, Ember, Frost, Hydroid, Mag, Nekros, Nova, Nyx, Oberon, Rhino, Saryn, Trinity, Valkyr, Vauban and Zephyr. They each have access to four different abilities for a distinct play style. Their main statistics differ in maximum health, shield capacity, energy, armour and sprint speed. Warframes and their weapons level up as they are being used and when enemies are killed.  This is rewarded with experience points called Affinity. Leveling up increases the power and also unlock mods to customize weapons and abilities. Mods make available deep customization, upgrading the five main attributes or altering the unique abilities. The abilities are tied to each type of warframe and offer both offensive and defensive powers. Cosmetic customization is available as well. Missions are selected starting from a main Origin planetary system. Although it is possible to play solo, the game encourages cooperative gameplay with up to four players. PvP is not supported. The game matches available players together in a squad and they can also vote on certain actions such as the mission. The missions take place in self-contained dungeon-like environments, so it is not possible to encounter other players than the initial team mates. Downed team mates can be revived for a set amount of times. By completing missions new regions are unlocked gradually. Missions can be replayed multiple times as there is a certain amount of randomness based on mutators.\n\nThe game is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes for movement (sprinting, jumping, sliding, rolling ... along with some parkour techniques), seeking cover and switching weapons. Enemies often appear in large numbers. There are also small puzzle elements in the environments based on puzzles and a hacking mini-game where a cipher needs to be solved against a time limit. Hacking a terminal can also be required when enemies lock down an area. There are different missions types, such as assassination (killing an enemy boss), capture (incapacitate and capture a target), deception (upload a datamass and escape), defense (defend an artifact against waves of enemies), extermination (defeat all enemies), hijack (take control of a Grin), interception (capture four towers, defend them and eventually kill all enemies), invasion (defeat a faction working together with another one), mobile defense (take a datamass through a number of consoles and fight off waves of enemies), rescue (locating and rescuing a hostage), sabotage (disabling machines), spy (hack terminals and bring back datamasses), and survival (surviving waves of enemies). In addition there are Alert missions only available for a limited time and missions played in a nightmare mode with a tougher difficulty level.\n\nCredits, ammo, resources, and mods are the main items found during missions and dropped by enemies. Credits are spent in a shop to buy new weapons, while a premium currency called Platinum purchased through microtransactions can also be used. Platinum can eliminate the crafting time of weapons (often up to twelve hours) and is used to unlock additional Warframe slots as well. To construct more advanced items and warframes, a blueprint and all of the required components need to be gathered. These can then be forged into a new item in the foundry. Blueprints are found during gameplay or constructed using resources.\n\nA distinct opponent is The Stalker. He appears when a player receives a death mark, obtained after killing certain bosses. There is then a chance that The Stalker will appear in the next mission and taunt the targeted Tenno, distorting the HUD and altering the environment. He will attack the targeted player after three taunts. If he does not succeed in killing the player and has his health drop below 10%, he flees and leaves behind equipment, such as a mod, a resource of a blueprint.\n\nWhile the base game is free to play along with the premium currency, there are different commercial packs such as <i>Warframe: Initiate Pack</i>, <i>Warframe: Starter Pack</i> and <i>Warframe: Tenno Pack</i> that offer a large amount of currency, mod cards and boosters together.",

      "description": "<i>Space Hulk</i> is a strategy game based on the 1989 board game of the same name (which is set in the <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> universe). In contrast to the <i>Space Hulk</i> games of the nineties, this product aims for a exact conversion of the original <i>Sins of Damnation</i> campaign. There is no plot and the campaign consists of twelve not interconnected missions (plus three tutorials) in which a Space Marine squad fights against aliens, the only enemy type. \n\nCombat is turn-based: in each round, every marine has four action points which can be used for actions like moving, attacking or turning (the viewing direction is important for combat, partly because the majority of time is spent in tight corridors); more costly are overwatch (the marine automatically fires if an alien enters the line of sight) and guard (improves defense in melee combat). At least in the easier difficulty level, the player also has a few general action points which can be used for any soldier. While there are multiple types of soldiers with different weaponry (e.g. melee or flame throwers) which have their advantages and disadvantages, the aliens aliens (which come in two flavors: Genestealers and Broodlords) are completely melee based. The result of fights rely on dice rolls and are deadly for one combatant - there are no hit points or character statistics. Another element taken from the original are \"blips\": waves which show the location of aliens, but not their quantity or type.",

      "description": "<i>Wolfenstein: The New Order</i> marks the return of one of the oldest first-person shooter franchises, Wolfenstein 3D, and once again puts player in the role of Polish-American soldier William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz. The game begins in 1946 with Blazkowicz chasing down his arch-enemy General Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse knowing that if he can kill Deathshead the Nazi war machine will be crippled. His plans backfire however and Blazkowicz is mortally wounded and put into a partial coma.  He is rescued by a Polish fishing vessel and taken to an asylum in Poland where 14 years pass as he is cared for by a nurse named Anya. When he finally awakens and saves Anya from the Nazi purge of the asylum, he soon learns that the war has ended and the Nazis won, thus placing the entire world under their rule. Deathshead was instrumental to this victory as he designed vicious bio-mechanical beasts and massive robots to gain superiority in the battlefield while also bombarding the United States with atomic bombs until their eventual surrender. Blazkowicz arms up once again and sets out to reignite the flames of rebellion by freeing his friends from the Kreisau Circle and toppling the Nazi regime!\n\nAs with previous entries in the series the game is a fast-paced and violent first-person shooter with some minor stealth and exploration elements. Players can hold several weapons at a time and said weapons can even be dual wielded. The weapons range from traditional weapons such as knives, pistols, and shotguns but later in game there is more exotic gear such as electricity spewing grenades, lasers, bladed weapons etc. You are also given a useful tool called the Laser Cutter, which allows you to cut through chains, fences, etc. to access alternate paths and secret items and areas.\n\nPlayers fight plenty of Nazi soldiers of varying strength, some wearing power armour and some are even bio-mechanical and blend flesh with technology. There are also bio-mechanical German Shepherds that act as guard dogs and can sneak up on the player to attempt to tear out his throat. In addition there are bigger fully robotic dogs that are extremely fast, lithe, and dangerous. Players have the option of taking a stealthy route and killing enemies silently with silenced weapons and knives that can be used for brutal backstabbing takedowns or can be thrown at enemies in the distance. \n\nAt times you will be notified of a Nazi officer in the area. Hunting him down and killing him quietly will reveal areas on the player's map. The game features a perk tree, which will level up based on certain challenges in the game such as killing 10 enemies silently with throwing knives to earn extra knife slots or killing several enemies while your health is overcharged (above 100%) to gain a perk where killing enemies grants small health boosts. These perks come in different categories (assault, demolition, stealth and tactical) and are based around the player's chosen play style.  \n\nAlso in line with previous games in the series, there are secrets to be collected. These include items that can give you a full map of the area, notes and letters that provide backstory, Enigma Codes which unlock special game modes, and Nazi gold and treasure.",

      "description": "<i>Transistor</i> is an action RPG set in the futuristic, sci-fi themed city Cloudbank. The player controls the character Red, a famous singer. She is attacked by the robot force Process led by a group called The Camerata, but the attempt fails and they leave behind Transistor, a greatsword-like weapon that has absorbed the man that was last killed with it. During the game Red is hunted down by the group and gets to wield the sword that has its own personality and acts like a companion.\n\nShe explores the environment, fighting enemies with a battle system that combines both real-time elements as well as a turn-based planning phase called Turn(). The turn-based approach is only available during battles where a part of the environment is fenced off. During the planning phase different actions can be selected, both movement and attacks, filling up an action bar near the top of the screen. When done they are executed one after the other. It takes some time before the bar is recharged, but meanwhile real-time movement and actions are still possible. Destroyed processes often leave behind cells that need to be picked up or enemies respawn. The areas usually have walls that can be used as cover. Through the battles Red gains experience used to acquire Functions, powers from the Process. These can be equipped as one of four techniques and can also be used to enhance existing techniques.\n\nA large portion of the gameplay is based around experimenting with different configurations of Functions. Skills are divided into active, passive and upgrade slots and most are unlocked by reaching new levels. Any function can be used for each of the three types of slots. The active slot is the main power and it can be enhanced with one or more functions in an upgrade slot. Passive slots are separate and provide passive effects. By switching and combining functions in active and upgrade slots, a specific fighting style can be created. This is encouraged in the game through the inspect command where parts of the story and the characters are revealed by equipping functions in certain configurations. Certain enemies are also more vulnerable to specific types of attacks. There are melee and ranged attacks, with additional effects such as a damage radius, a bounce effect etc. The Jaunt function is used to quickly get out of the way and a 'backstab' position behind an enemy often provides more damage. Through certain functions enemies can be turned to provide help. The screen to customize functions is activated by using a terminal. Optionally limiters can be used to make the opponents of the Process stronger, but with more experience in return.",

      "description": "<i>Lifeless Planet</i> is a game where the player controls an astronaut who signed up to a one-way mission to explore an inhabitable planet far away. After travelling for fifteen years, he crashes/lands and discovers it is a barren wasteland instead of the lush scenery that was promised. His crew is gone and they seemed to have moved on before him in the exploration. There is no time to waste, as an oxygen leak presses him to move fast. He discovers traces left behind by his crew and then finds out the planet may not be uninhabited at all; there is life and he quickly discovers an abandoned town of Russian origin.\n\nThe character can be moved around freely in a large and seemingly boundless environment. There is however a linear path to follow. The game is divided in about 20 areas, each with their own type of scenery set on the surface and underground, with both natural and artificial environments. Next to moving around, the astronaut is able to jump and can use a quick burst of his jet pack for a short moment. After locating additional jet pack fuel and adjusting to the low-gravity environment, multiple bursts in succession are possible to travel farther. Later on the discovery of a mobile robotic arm introduces a way to handle objects that cannot be touched directly or cannot be handled with his suit. The focus is almost entirely on exploring and a lot of distance needs to be covered on foot. It also contains some minor puzzles based around platforming and finding ways to progress through the environment. Interaction with the environment is for instance provided by the ability to push objects. The astronaut's thoughts can be read in a log through his Holo Tab.\n\nThe later PS4/X1 <i>Premier Edition</i> releases have new music, visual upgrades (especially for the terrain), new content through audio and text logs, and Russian audio localization. For PC the <i>Premier Edition</i> was provided as a free update, also replacing the original version.",

The backgrounds are reworked for higher resolutions with subtler shades of light, and crisper detail and edges to the polygons and animations. It is still possible to switch to the original graphics. This version also contains remastered sound effects and three difficulty modes.\n\nTwo to three years later it was also ported to PC and a variety of console platforms with platform-specific tweaks. On the GOG distribution portal <i>15th Anniversary Edition</i> was replaced with this version, but both versions are still accessible as a single package.",

      "description": "<i>Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut</i> is an enhanced version of the space action game Strike Suit Zero, but also the first release of the game for console platforms.\n\nTo tone down the initial difficulty spike the beginning of the game has been reworked. The game now has a tutorial mission that also incorporates the Strike Suit (Strike mode) next to the regular flying (Pursuit mode) so it can be practised before it needs to be used in further missions. In addition the checkpoints are more numerous and closer together, and the entire campaign has been reworked. Next to the thirteen missions of the campaign, it incorporates the Heroes of the Fleet DLC with five additional missions, set before the main campaign as a prologue. There are new ships in the game with the Raptor from the Raptor DLC and the Marauder model that was previously limited to Kickstarter backers for the game's crowd funding campaign. They are not available right away, but need to be unlocked by playing the game.\n\nThe gameplay has been refined, for instance by altering the sensitivity of the aiming reticule. To help completing objectives in time and to improve navigation, targeting the nearest enemy now points to the one relevant for the current mission. Weapon damage and armour durability has been re-balanced as well. Shields now last longer and the improved aiming sensitivity makes it easier to maneuver past enemies by strafing for instance.\n\nVisually the game has been reworked with more dynamic lighting and new textures. The story has been reworked and the game's audio has been re-recorded with new voice actors. The game's soundtrack was remixed with ten new arranged tracks.",

Visually, there is an overhaul of the menus and the netcode has been rebalanced with better matchmaking. Players leaving the game prematurely also receive a lower ranking now. In multiplayer the game can be played offline with two- to four-player player split-screen or with six players online. This version also adds a new stealth-focused map and just like the PC version additional skins are supported through DLC.\n\nThe July 2014 patch adds two additional characters from Awesomenauts: Starstorm: Penny Fox and Ted McPain. It also introduces custom games where private matches can be customized with an option to switch the mode into Team Deathmatch and Randomnauts. Other fixes from the PC version are carried over as well.",

It is set in the year 2100 when mankind first sets foot on the planet Mars. The player acts as the commander in charge of the mission. There are various tasks to complete, such as docking the space ship, scanning for distant galaxies with a satellite, calibrating a solar collector, collecting samples with a magnetic crane, using a spider to research Martian symbols, stabilizing gravity, refueling, deactivating Mars' defense systems and unlocking the secrets of a pyramid as the end game. Multiball is set in zero gravity. There is also a mission when the ship can freeze and the ball turns white.\n\nThere are two regular flippers at the bottom and an additional one near the mid right to reach a lane. The outer parts of the fields have lanes and they also lead to the spinners. In the centre there are various holes. The level has many 3D animations such as the space ship docking on the table and a spider hopping on the bottom of the table to activate kickback.",

      "description": "<i>Destiny</i> is a futuristic first-person shooter set in a persistent world. When humans first set foot on Mars they discovered the Traveler, a giant sphere that then allowed mankind to colonize space quickly. Centuries later the Darkness, an enemy of the Traveler, arrived and waged war against it and all of its creations. The Traveler is forced to scarify itself as a measure of protection and what is left of humanity on Earth is forced to live in a city constructed underneath. The Traveler enlists warriors known as Guardians with special abilities as a personal army. These Guardians are guided by Ghosts, artificial intelligence. The player's character is found by such a Ghost (acting as a robot companion in the game) and becomes a Guardian.\n\nAt the start the player chooses a class (Titan, Hunter or Warlock - corresponding with the classic Fighter, Rogue and Mage) and then customizes the appearance through race (Human, Awoken or Exo), gender, face, hair and marking. Each class has distinct abilities. The Titan is a fighter with an advanced mech suit, the Hunter is a bounty hunter with a knack for reconnaissance and ranged weapons, and the Warlock is a magical being that uses spells and explosives. Each class has various subclasses (unlocked at level 15) and specific abilities and statistics. None of the weapons in the game are restricted to a single class. The most distinct differences are the grenade types, jump abilities, melee attack and a special ability. The game borrows elements from the MMORPG genre in its design, with the Tower as a main hub zone to interact with NPCs, buy weapons, gear and Ghost upgrades, receive mail, buy and upgrade ships etc. Rewards for completing missions can also usually be collected here. The other major zones are Earth, the Moon, Mars and Venus, with some additional locations. While fighting, movement and jumps are important when confronting enemies. A Guardian can wield up to three main weapons (primary, special and heavy) next to grenades and other abilities. Only one weapon of each type can be equipped, but nine more for each type can be stored in an inventory to swap them.\n\nShips are used to travel through space to other planets. These voyages are not an interactive scene however as the game does not have a complete open world design. Each planet has its own story and various quests. Players complete missions by defeating enemies, collecting loot. Glimmer, the main currency is used to buy upgrades, vehicles, emblems ... The character also gains experience and levels up, accessing new abilities. From level 18 Vanguard Marks are unlocked as an additional currency for high-end gear, along with Vanguard Reputation as a reward for completing bounties. There are daily and weekly challenges to earn Marks, but the amount that can be earned has time constrictions. From level 20 the general experience system is replaced by Mote of Light. At that level the characters also gets to join one of three factions: Dead Orbit, New Monarchy or Future War Cult. The main story consists of different campaign missions that need to be completed for The Speaker, unlocked gradually and opened up on Earth, Moon, Venus and Mars respectively. Once unlocked however, they can be completed in any order. Next to the mission progression it is possible to enter a planet in exploration mode, offering free exploration. Each planet generally has five major story missions. These can be completed alone or in groups of six players working together.\n\nPlayers can also optionally organize themselves in Fireteams for Strike missions, similar to MMORPG dungeons, that are harder with various mini-bosses and bosses. Fireteams are organized through online matchmaking and it is possible to make them public or private, and invite players. Only in Fireteams is voice chat possible. Outside of it communication is limited to gestures and prompts. Players also do not see all other online players at that location, only a selection. For the instance missions, the player's character (and possibly other team members) are drawn in a private part in the game, cut off from the open game world. In these section characters can revive each other and there are checkpoints for respawns. Loot is personalized and does not need to be distributed between players. Each planet contains five major loot chests. Certain weapons and armour have a ranking system where they become better over time. There are also various types of engrams, a type of pattern for weapons or amour that can be turned into a special item with colour coding for the rarity level. Decoding them improves a separate ranking system with leveling to access additional engrams. When dead, other players can attempt to revive the player's character with its Ghost nearby or eventually it respawns. Moving around on planets can be done on speeder bikes.\n\nThere are also Raids, much harder cooperative missions added gradually by the developer that do not support matchmaking and can only be taken on with players at a high level with high-end gear. Unlike Strike missions, no objectives or directions are given, players have to figure it out for themselves. Raids can be paused and resumed, unlike most of the rest of the game, but are reset after a weekly cycle. Competitive multiplayer is available in the The Crucible PvP game mode in a separate location. It offers game modes unlocked gradually including Clash, Control, Skirmish and Rumble. They come with different team sizes and include team deathmatch, capturing zones, team modes with vehicles and more. Level differences between players are nullified except for the skill tree unlocks, but the strength of the gear, weapons and equipped items makes a significant difference. The Crucible offers Crucible Marks as a currency along with Crucible Reputation.",

      "description": "Fifteen years after the events of Ridley Scott's <i>Alien</i> Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda is looking for answers. She is an engineer working for Weiland-Yutani Corporation. When she finds out that the logs from USCSS Nostromo have been located and transported to Sevastopol space station she decides to join a small crew sent by Weiland-Yutani to retrieve the data. Little does she know that the ship that has found the logs reached Sevastopol with a terrifying passenger on board, the one that murdered the majority of station's population and left the survivors cowering in fear.   \n\n<i>Alien: Isolation</i> is a survival horror game. It is set on the Sevastopol space station where Amanda is searching for USCSS Nostromo logs. Sevastopol is split into many areas, and a certain degree of freedom is given to the player: areas may have several alternative routes to the goal, hidden rooms and ventilation shafts; also Amanda may (and later needs to) backtrack through the station. As the game goes on Amanda's tools will be upgraded and she will be able to get access to previously out of reach areas.    \n\nAmanda is an engineer, so she is able to loot containers and bodies for resources and craft devices like noisemakers, smoke bombs, or Molotov cocktails, mainly used to distract the enemy. Later she acquires a flashlight, a motion detector and several types of weapons to defend herself against humanoid enemies (groups of hostile survivors or androids). However, Amanda is not a fighter, and each encounter should be carefully planned. Many actions take some time, for example to use a medpack Amanda needs to stand perfectly still. \n\nWhen Amanda draws attention of the alien, stealth is the only way to survive. The alien cannot be harmed, and it kills Amanda in a single hit. In most cases it doesn't follow a predetermined scripted route, but instead relies on its senses to track Amanda down.\n\nIn addition to the main story mode there's Survivor mode in which the player needs to escape from a specially designed map fulfilling secondary objectives along the way, while being aggressively hunted by the alien. This mode includes online leaderboards.  ",

      "description": "<i>Earth Defense</i> is a DLC pinball table for Pinball FX2 (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows) and Zen Pinball 2 (PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U). The PS3 and PS Vita versions are Cross-Buy. After buying that version, it can be transferred for free to the PS4 version as well.\n\nIn this table your are the captain of the Earth Defense Special Forces and you need to defend Pinball City against the Flip-Bot and his minions. The Flip-Bot is a huge robot in the top right part of the table and takes up a large portion of the screen. To defeat him ten medals need to be earned through different missions. You can attempt to attack the bot directly, you can fight mini-bosses and you have to help civilians escape. In the City Destroyer mission you need to keep the ball in the upper part of the playfield for ten seconds. In Data Bowl you hit the drop targets in front of the Flip-Bot to steal the robot plans. In Artillery you use the launch cannon to choose a trajectory and then you have a limited amount of time to reach that target. You can also save a girl and there is an airstrike and a panic multiball with many jackpot lanes. The robot can toy with the ball by launching shots, changing the ball's trajectory. In Invasion you have a limited amount of time to shoot the ball into the rescue hole to stop the invasion. If not, Flip-Bot keeps adding balls (up to three) until you are overwhelmed.\n\nThe table focuses on the robot and the two large ramps reach around it. There is also a center ramp and an additional flipper in the top right next to the regular ones to reach another lane. Many activities are activated by launching the ball over the same ramp multiple times in succession. The left part of the screen is used to access a cannon, a subway to transport civilians, and a large UFO. There are two outlanes on the right and three on the left. Most of the targets can be found in the middle of the screen.",

      "description": "<i>Risk of Rain</i> is a roguelike platformer with a sci-fi setting. The player is the lone survivor of a space train that got shot out of orbit and crash landed on a mysterious planet.\n\nEach stage starts with the player spawning in a random spot. The first aim is to find a teleporter, also randomly spawned somewhere in that stage. When the teleporter is found and activated, it will take 90 seconds to be fully active. During this time, several enemies will spawn, including a boss. After the teleporter loading time is complete, the player must then kill all enemies that are left in order to be teleported to the next stage.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the game is that difficulty increases over time: a difficulty bar is shown in the top right corner of the screen. Every five minutes the difficulty increases one level, so the quicker the player finds his way out of stages, the easier the later stages are. In order to keep up with the challenge, the players must equip their characters with items that were being carried by the space train. There are more than 100 different items (most of which must be unlocked), each with a different effect, such as inflicting damage to enemies as they approach the player, increasing healing rate, slowing down hit enemies, double jump, etc. The effects are stackable, so if two or more items of the same kind are collected a multiplier will be added to it. Items are dropped by boss enemies, but are more commonly found in locked chests. To unlock chests, players must collect money dropped by enemies when killed. Money is also used to activate drones that will help the player.\n\nPlayers can choose different characters, each one with different skills. Every character has 4 different actions, like different weapons or defensive maneuvers, plus one usable item slot. There are 12 different characters available, but they must be unlocked by finding items or performing some achievements.",

      "description": "<i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i> is the eleventh main game in the first-person shooter series. The single-player campaign is set in the future, around 2054, when Atlas, a private military corporation led by Jonathan Irons, has become the most powerful military organization on the planet. The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack's father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq.\n\nAs the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier's abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other <i>Call of Duty</i> games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy.\n\nFor multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the <i>Black Ops II</i> Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly.\n\nLike many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. One to four players work together to survive multiple rounds, fighting off waves of enemies. There are four tiers to unlock and eleven rounds in total.",

      "description": "<i>Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions</i> is the fourth game in the arcade shooter series. It is made by a new developer, but with a large group of people who were involved with the previous games. The biggest novelty is the introduction of 3D environments, sometimes only aesthetically in actually flat environments, but also with complete 3D levels where the ship moves around a cube or globe in any direction.\n\nThe main game mode is called Adventure. It offers a level path with additional levels unlocked gradually and different game modes such as Boss (defeat the boss before time expires), Checkpoint (clear waves for extra time to reach the target score), Deadline (reach the target score before time runs out), Evolved (reach the target score with only three lives) and Titan (reach the target score with only one life). Each level has three targets based on performance to earn stars and these are required to keep unlocking new levels. In the boss mode for instance defeating the boss as quickly as possible is not sufficient, you need to get many kills in the provided time to reach a high score as well.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous games. The player controls a space ship with unlimited ammo that can be moved in any direction in a small arena. As in a twin stick shooter the ship can also shoot in any direction regardless of movement. Generally the goal is to survive as long as possible clearing waves of enemies. Defeated enemies leave behind green geoms that add to a score multiplier when collected. Sometimes a small group of objects spawns. When destroyed, a better default weapon is provided for a short time, such as rapid fire, more bullets or bullets that travel to different directions at once. Also returning is a limited amount of bombs that clear the entire screen, but without providing points.\n\nEntirely new to the series is a companion drone. By defeating bosses different drones are unlocked and a currency is earned by completing levels to upgrade them multiple times. The available drones are Attack, Collect, Defend, Ram, Snipe. They are controlled by the CPU and stay close to the player's ship, providing assistance in various ways. Next to bombs, five supers can be unlocked as additional weapons with limited ammo. They cover parts of the grid in small explosives, fire homing missiles, create a defensive black hole etc. Before starting a game one drone and one super can be selected.\n\nThe game modes of the previous games, available as single sessions, are available in a separate Classic mode. They are Deadline Classic, Evolved Classic, King Classic (no guns outside king zones), Pacifism Classic (no guns, move through barriers to destroy nearby enemies), and Waves Classic.\n\nThere are competitive game modes, both offline (up to four players) and online (up to eight players). In the Stock mode the first team to kill the boss wins. When time runs out instead, the team with the highest score wins. Personal ammo is limited to 50 bullets. Players need to collect ammo packets to gain more bullets and these can be shared between the team players. In the Summoner game mode the team with the highest score wins when time runs out. In this mode the ships need to shoot towers to spawn enemies the team can kill to receive points. The other team also attempts to claim towers however to have enemies spawn for them. In both game modes the multiplier is shared between all team members and if one member dies it is reset for everyone.\n\nIn March 2015 a free update was provided that renamed the game <i>Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions - Evolved</i>. It includes a new Ultimate mode with new levels, new game modes and grid shapes, a new sweep drone and detonator super, eight new enemy types, a new Hardcore mode with no drones allowed, Retro Evolved Classic as a new game type in the Classic mode, and a number of tweaks to the gameplay.",

Races take place on short tracks with the camera positioned in a fixed, isometric-like view next to the track. As the camera stays fixed relative to the car, the controls need to be adjusted based on the position on the track. The game is set on three planets with sixteen tracks in total. During races there is no health; when knocked off the track the car automatically respawns. All racers are kept in view at all times. When one car lags behind it eventually respawns closer to the other racers.\n\nIn the career mode races need to be completed based on different game modes. There are regular circuit races, time trials, death races and king races. In death races races the cars are chased by a giant spiked steamroller. Every now and then it approaches, destroying all cars in the way until only one remains. Points are then awarded based on the position and there are multiple sessions until a survivor race is completed. When knocked off the track in a survivor race, the car does not respawn until the next session. King races are won by staying in the lead longer than the other racers, regardless of the ending position. By winning races points, cups and medals are earned. Cups are objectives specific for each track. By doing well additional tracks and racers are unlocked. Each racer has different statistics based on mass, acceleration and handleability. Slow cars have little acceleration, but are not affected much by projectiles. Fast cars have great acceleration, but are easily knocked off the track. There are also racers that slightly hover above the track.\n\nWhile racing various pick-ups spawn. There is a boost that can be activated by the player, either as a regular boost or different types of strong ones that can also easily catapult a car into the void. Weapon pick-ups include an autogun, a seeking missile, a chainsaw blade, a slime shot that slows down and a soundwave. As opponents cannot be destroyed permanently (except for survivor races), the main goal is to use weapons to knock opponents off the tracks and gain the lead. There is also a focus on drifting through corner and avoiding obstacles and the track borders. The game supports multiplayer for up to four players offline and eight players online.",
