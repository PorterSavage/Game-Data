      "description": "One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, <em>Pac-Man</em> stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\n\nPac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.",

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.\n ",

      "description": "<i>Moon Patrol</i> is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate \"stage\" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. \n\nDangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. \n\nAfter completing the first course (the \"Beginner Course\") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course.

This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...\n\n<i>Bubble Bobble</i> is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.",

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the \"Black Warriors\", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.\n\nUsing whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.\n\nThe NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.",

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.\n\nThe original arcade version of \"Double Dragon II\" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, \"Double Dragon II\" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.\n\nThe NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.",

The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up. Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  The game also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together. The game's soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, <i>Paint It Black</i>.",

Many of the changes in this year's KOF release come in the form of improved graphics, sound effects, music and totally redone character sprites. The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of \"Rush\" multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '96</i> has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default \"Team Fighting\" mode or the traditional \"Single Fighter\" style of gameplay, plus the \"Versus\" and \"Survival\" gameplay modes.",

Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden \"alternate\" versions that may also be used in-game. \n\nKOF '98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters '97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes. In addition to the Survival battle mode and the ability to choose between Single Play or Team Play, versions of the game on console systems that use CDs to contain their media (PSX, Neo-Geo CD) also include an Art Gallery one may look at.",

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...\n\n<i>The King of Fighters '95</i> introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of <i>The King of Fighters '95</i> is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the \"team edit\" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the \"team edit\" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.",

A new opponent, Wolfgang Krauser, has come forth to begin a new Fatal Fury tournament. The Lone Wolves return, with new faces amongst them. Only one can be declared the winner though. \n\nThe player can choose one from eight playable characters: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Big Bear, Jubei Yamada, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, and Mai Shiranui. The game has four bosses. The combat system is more complex than in the first game, supporting four keys to attack. The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.\n",

This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the \"alternate\" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden \"maniac\" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.",

Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. \r\n\r\nThis aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.",

You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!\n\nThere are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a \"challenge stage\" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.\n\nCertain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last \"life,\" you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.\n\nA summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final \"hit ratio\"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.",

Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.\n\nIn each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the \"power ball\" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the \"E\" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.\n\nThe more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.",

Missiles, tanks, UFO's, and other enemy artillery can all be found and will try to stop you. Colliding with any of these enemies, enemy fire, or the landscape will cause you to lose one of your planes. To fight back, your plane is equipped with both bombs and guns which can destroy most of the enemies you'll encounter. Your plane has a limited amount of fuel, and you'll crash if you run out. To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally. ",

In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.",

      "description": "As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.\nWhile climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:<ul><li>Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.</li>\n<li>Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.</li>\n<li>Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.</li>\n<li>Electrical \"Nichibutsu\" signs with a dangling live wire.</li>\n<li>Falling \"Crazy Climber\" signs.</li>\n<li>King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.</li></ul>The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. \n\nCrazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is \"The Lucky Balloon\", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.",

To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty.

      "description": "Argus is a standard vertical shooting game like Raptor: Call of the Shadows or Tyrian; this game bears a strong resemblance to Terra Cresta, an arcade game.  There is no story, this game is a straight arcade-action shooter.\n\nThe game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship.  Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them.   While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary.  Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.\n",

You and/or a friend must choose one of three characters to play as, each with different speeds at which they control their ships. Then select three weapons to use for the front and back of your ship. During play, you must travel to every planet in the solar system, and defeat the various enemy ships and the boss near the end of the planet. Your weapons can be upgraded during the battle, and you can also collect HyperBombs if you want to do maximum damage. The soundtrack is reminiscent of early 1990's \"rave\" music.",

However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant's way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS.\n\nThe character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), <i>The King of Fighters 2001</i> has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.",

      "description": "The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...\n\nThis year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).\n\nLike The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.",

The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan's stage) uses a single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid attacks.\n\nBut the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle \"The Newcomers\") are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury's main cast: Rick Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a young female Chinese martial arts fighter.",

Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.",

Soldiers have been sent to this place with one mission: Destroy them all.\n\n<i>Alien Shooter</i> is an isometric action game in which the player must shoot his way through swarms of alien creatures and complete mission objectives which invariably involves stopping the spread of the alien creatures. \n\nChoosing from one of two characters, each with slightly different statistics (the male character can carry more ammo and take more hits, while the female shoots more accurately and moves faster), the player can start the 10-mission campaign or see how long they can survive endless waves of aliens in survival mode. \n\nBoth modes feature firefights against the aliens using 9 progressively more destructive weapons, from the simple dual pistols to the destructive MAGMA Minigun. Survival is quick and dirty slaughter. In campaign mode, the player will travel through different areas of the base; restoring power, destroying alien entry sites, and picking up cash to buy weapons, ammunition, implants that raise attributes, body armor and various gadgets at the mid-level shop. The aliens are at first simple grunts which have only one tactic which is to rush the player character; however, later on, most are equipped with weaponry and are much more numerous. The game sometimes has hundreds of aliens swarming the character at the same time.\n\nThe color of blood can be changed between red and green, as well as locked with a password.",

The sequel removes the different horizontal planes of the original and thus the ranged combat is somewhat restrained, but as the title implies, Kizuna Encounter adds tag-teaming to the gameplay mechanics. Instead of choosing one fighter, you select a team of two and can switch between each character whenever you feel like it mid-fight.",

New for the sequel is the inclusion of swords as your default weapons, which now feature both high and low attacks, as well as a block move that allows you to parry enemy attacks. Collecting orbs gives you weapon upgrades and energy attacks, as well as the ability to morph into any of the three spirits released in the original which give you a new arsenal of moves and powers.",

      "description": "A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, <i>Twinkle Star Sprites</i> tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.\n\nThe game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area,  a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special \"boss\" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.\n\nEach player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.",

If they are able to defeat the powerful monster enslaved in them, the Waku Waku balls will grant the lucky victor whatever wish they desire.\n\nThe game was created as a parody of anim\u00e9 series in general, WW7 pools together all the mainstays of the genre and has them fight against each other. From furry catgirls and effeminate, super-cool elfs to cute pok\u00e9mon-like creatures and dumb and loud heroes.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is a 2D fighting game in which two characters try to defeat each other in one-on-one combat using their attacks and special moves. The player selects his/her character and then tries to defeat all opponents in succession. As in most games of the genre each character possesses individual strengths and movesets, plus a power-bar that gets charged by unleashing special moves that allows one to trigger super moves and even unblockable attacks at the expense of power slots.\n\nFeatures arcade and Vs gameplay modes as well as an artwork gallery for the Saturn version which showcases the bright colorful art design of WW7.",

Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.\n\nUnique to <i>Aggressors of Dark Kombat</i> is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.",

      "description": "Another one-on-one fighting game straight from the arcades for the Neo Geo. <i>Ninja Master's</i> [sic] is set in feudal Japan, and tells the story of 10 unique ninjas who fight each other for their own personal reasons and the chance to defeat the evil Nobunaga and bring peace back to Japan.\n\nAs expected for the genre, the game pits your selected character against a series of opponents in best-of-three-round matches, with your objective being to deplete your opponent's health bar with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific control motions) and super moves (which rely on a power gauge). All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano-a-mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly, even changing the way basic attacks work.\n\nUses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P vs gameplay.",

There are 100 levels of alien armada to get through. Your adventures will take from from the Earth to the Moon and finally to Titan via other stops in between.\n\n\nPower-ups are available through simple pick-up from bonus ships you shoot down which will give you temporary weapon upgrades or point collecting upgrades. The points you collect on each level can be used between levels to purchase upgrades to your weaponry and armour. Your shields will also need to be replenished between levels if you are shot, while other upgrades you purchase become permanent components.\n\n\nEnemy ships for the most part move in set patterns excepting the five mother-ships which move in a more aggressive pattern of their own choosing. Points are rewarded for efficiency in shooting enemies and for capturing enemy aliens who may parachute down off their crashing ship. Bonus rounds in between some levels allow the player to earn upgrades and points while an online high-score table allows the player to boast his/her scores online.",

Unlimited however gives the player an unlimited amount of lives, and re-spawn is instantaneous. In this mode, the player can compete to finish the game with as little extra lives as possible. Finishing games in Unlimited Mode also unlocks the stages for play in Classic Mode.\n\n<i>R-Type Dimensions</i> also benefits from Xbox Live enhancements such as leaderboards and online co-operative mode.",

      "description": "<i>Strikers 1945 Plus</i> is a port of the classic Neo-Geo arcade game. Unlike other games in the series, this is the first time the game is officially available outside of arcades.\n\nThis game is a remixed version of sorts which includes elements from the two previous games in the series, Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II. There are six different planes to choose from (plus one secret one), each with their own attacks and special moves. Player weapons are weak to begin with, but firepower is improved (and secondary missiles gained!) by capturing Power-Ups. Super bombs can also be picked up, which destroy or damage any enemy or boss that is near the explosion.\n\nThere are also special moves which are obtained by charging up a gauge on the side of the screen. The more damage inflicted upon the enemy, the faster it fills up. Once the gauge is completely full, hold down the attack button for an instant to unleash the special attack. Several special shots can be held in reserve and used when necessary.\n\nA new addition to the PSP version is an Endless Mode, which allows game  replay with an enhanced difficulty immediately after the final boss is defeated.",

The Kage Ichizoku clan has caused a giant tower to appear in the middle of the city, and it's up to our heroes Joe (Player One) and Hayabusa (Player Two) to take them down.\n\nBoth characters can attack incoming enemies by using Shuriken (throwing stars) which can be upgraded into small, yet powerful, flaming stars. Speed powerups to make you move faster are also available. You can also pick up weapons such as Axes, Swords and Nunchucks, which are slightly more powerful, but your attack range goes down slightly. You also have access to a special move which makes your character fly across the screen, hitting all enemies in his way. Both characters can also unleash a fairly strong special attack which destroys many enemies on the screen, or does heavy damage to the bosses, but it takes away a quarter of your life.\n\nAs you go through the game, you'll be able to recruit enemy characters to aid you in your quest. Each new character has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as its own special attack.",

Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.",

      "description": "According to an ancient legend of the Kingdom of Etrulia, should the people get corrupted by wickedness, demons and devils would break through the Gate of Doom, ruling the land as their own. However, by the same time four heroes with different powers would be summoned by the Force Divine to destroy the monsters of darkness and using the magic gem and magic crown they would try to lock the Gate of Doom forever.\n\n<i>Dark Seal</i> was originally released in arcades in 1990. It is a beat'em-up in a fantasy set. One or two players (in co-op mode) can choose among 4 different characters: the Knight (who has a strong weapon), the Wizard (who has powerful magic), the Bard (who's immune to poison) and the Ninja (who has high-speed movement). The characters are viewed in an isometric perspective and can move and attack in all 8 directions, though they can't move while attacking.\n\nAll characters wield mid-range weapons. The Knight uses a morning star, the Wizard uses a magic flame pillar, the Bard uses an elastic spetum and the Ninja uses shurikens. They can also use magical attacks when a magic meter shown at the side of the screen is full. A book of spells keeps flipping its pages, showing a different spell in each page. Once the player hits the spell button, the spell showing in that moment in the book is activated, transforming him or her into different elemental forms (a tornado, a sparkling cloud, a bush of fire, etc.), lasting until the magic meter is depleted.\n\nThe enemies are typical fantasy ones, such as skeletons, ghouls, kobolds, etc. Some of them can poison or confuse the players. Throughout the game, chests can be found containing items can be collected to fill the characters life and magic meters, as well as items such as armor parts which can improve players stats.",

The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.\n\nPower-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:\n<ul><li>Yellow: grants bonus points;</li>\n<li>White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;</li>\n<li>Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);</li>\n<li>Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;</li>\n<li>Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.</li></ul>\nThe green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.\n\nOne shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.\n\nIn the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join \"hand-to-hand\" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.",

      "description": "<i>Fast Striker</i> is an arcade-style vertical shooter with a science fiction setting. While the game is essentially 2D, the backgrounds consists of pre-rendered 3D graphics. This game features six stages with over 40 enemy types.\n\nYou can choose between 3 game modes (Novice, Original and Maniac) with different scoring systems. The modes differ, for example, in the set of available techniques. In comparison to the Novice mode, the Original mode features a shield to protect the ship, which can be activated for a short time, and holding the down the spread fire button will also shoot rockets after a few moments. Furthermore, the enemies are colored differently in Novice mode to make them more visible, and you collect golden stars as part of the scoring system. The Maniac mode adds some new ways to get higher scores. For example, the distance between your ship and an enemy influences the score: you get a larger bonus the nearer you are to the enemy ship when you destroy it. Destroying many enemies in short time will also increase the number of awarded points. Last, you can activate a \"Grind Mode\" by focusing your ship's laser beam on a huge enemy. The beam will turn green after a while and then all destroyed enemies will give a higher score.",

Additionally there are environmental obstacles like poisonous gas or walls. Of course the player can collect power ups to upgrade the ship, e.g. speed-ups or a large variation of weaponry. Each of the seven levels has its own set of weaponry which suits the enemies. The big exception are smaller ships which stay near to the main ship.

King Caudwener knew that the goblins began mass production of magical weapons. Assassinating Gobligan seemed the only option. Four warriors volunteer to infiltrate the goblin empire and carry out this dangerous task.\n\n<i>Mah\u014d Daisakusen</i> (<i>Sorcer Striker</i> in the arcades) is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with a medieval fantasy theme mixed with modern weaponry and devices. The player can choose to control any of the four characters: fighter Gain, witch Chitta, reptile samurai Miyamoto, or necromancer Bornnam. Each of the characters flies through the stages and attacks with three types of main weapons, distinguished by color and taking different shapes depending on the chosen character: accurate homing fire (red), side weapons (blue), powerful straight attack (green). The weapons are changed by collecting magic books, and their power is enhanced by flying over coins that appear on the stages.",

      "description": "In <i>Jetpack Joyride</i> the player controls Barry, a young man who steals an experimental jetpack from supposedly evil scientists and has to escape the lab. The game scrolls automatically, making Barry advance from left to right at ever increasing speed. The backgrounds alternate randomly, interspersing science labs with warehouses, gardens, etc.\n\nBarry can use his jetpack to stay in the air for an unlimited amount of time, as long as the player keeps tapping (for short distances) or pressing the screen. Though the scientists are classified as enemies, they do not attempt to harm Barry and can be knocked down themselves by various means. The hazards consist of zappers (immobile or rotating around their own axis), missiles that randomly shoot from the left side after a short warning, and lasers that often occupy the entire screen, making the player manipulate Barry's altitude to avoid them. Contact with any of these hazards will end the run, forcing the player to restart from the beginning under normal circumstances.\n\nBarry can also collect coins scattered through the stages, as well as vehicles and upgrades that randomly appear as icons in the middle of the screen. These upgrades consist of a mecha that stomps scientists; a speedy motorcycle; a mechanical bird; a robotic dragon with a fire attack; a gravity suit that allows Barry to walk on the ceiling; and a \"freaking crazy teleporter\" that changes altitude in an instant. All these devices have different controls and are usually harder to navigate than a jetpack-riding Barry; however, they also protect him from instant death.\n\nSpin tokens can be collected in the stages, each leading to a slot machine mini-game after the run is over. The player has a chance of winning money prizes and various power-ups, such as bombs and blasts that throw the already dead Barry a short distance forward (for a possible better record); head starts, which make Barry automatically rush through a portion of the stage during the next run; \"second chance\" (revives Barry immediately); and double coin (each coin counts as double during the next run). Most of these power-ups can also be bought in the store for coins; in addition, the player can upgrade vehicles with magnets that attract coins, as well as customize Barry's jetpack, clothes, haircut, etc.\n\nThough the main goal is always to survive for as long as possible in a single run, the player is also encouraged to complete various \"missions\" that eventually increase his or her level, leading to coin rewards and achievement badges. These missions range from collecting a certain amount of coins or running a certain distance to more elaborate tasks such as near-missing zappers, staying in the same vehicle for a set amount of time, and so on.",

      "description": "<i>Stakes Winner</i> is a horse racing game. \n\nRaces can be entered by one or two players and involve eight horses struggling for victory; each of the eight horses (in the order which the game presents them in: White Heat, Hot Sand, Euro Union, Asian Hope, Brave Lady \u2014the sole female one\u2014, Be Silent, US Fighter, Sky Dancer) given for selection is characterized by three parameters (named \u00ababilities\u00bb in-game): speed, stamina, strength, all measured in stars from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. Rival horses are not available for selection to the player: their names are, for instance, the ominous- or hilarious-sounding \u00abMr Devious\u00bb, \u00abRed Vision\u00bb, \u00abSunk Star\u00bb, \u00abHelpMe\u00bb, \u00abOhMygod\u00bb, \u00abNutseater\u00bb. The names are also differentiated by being written all in capital letters the latter ones, normally the former.\n\nBefore the beginning of the race, while horses approach the starting point, the name of the circuit, course plan, prize money and circuit time record are displayed. During the race, the indicators on the screen are: the course plan (with a moving coloured circular indicator representing the position of each contender), the chronometric indication of time, the horse's energy bar with a line composed of three segments beside it: a red one (that means the horse is in its full strength), a yellow and a blue one (denoting lack of strength); a representation of the horse's face, which portrays its, more or less fatigued or strong status and how intensely it is running.\n\nThe game controls require the use of two buttons and the control stick or directional pad: one button controls the reins, for slight acceleration, which consumes a little of the horse's energies. The other one controls the whip, for sharp acceleration: this consumes the horse's force significantly. Should the energy be consumed entirely, racing will have to be given up for a while. Two rapid touches on the joystick or directional pad in the direction of travel allow to force away a horse blocking the player's road to victory; two rapid touches in the direction opposite to that of travel vigorously reduce speed. \n\nPower-up items represented by icons placed on the course may be taken during the race, raising one of the parameters of the horse by one for some time, giving a temporary boost in speed, or partially restoring the horse. Weather conditions change from time to time: the drizzle may be an obstacle, worsening the status of the terrain. A real second corresponds to two seconds in game (therefore, for instance, a one-minute race will last half a minute).\n\nAfter every stage, the track length, as well as the prize money awarded to the first three finishers are augmented. The series of levels are separated by training stages. If done successfully, training on the dirt or on the turf respectively increases the horse's stamina and speed, whereas training on or \u00abagainst\u00bb,the hill strengthens it. Success in training session is to be attained by pushing a button as rapidly as possible, while avoiding assorted obstacles and hindrances. The player can choose what type of training to opt for.\n\nRace courses proceed in the ensuing sequence: <ul>\n<li>Maidens</li>\n<li>Sapporo Juvenile</li>\n<li>Juvenile Stakes</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>2000 Guineas</li>\n<li>Derby Stakes (the $1.300.000 prize money is mistakenly displayed as \u00ab$ 130.000\u00bb)</li>\n<li>St. Leger (BC Classic in the original arcade game)</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>Japan Grandprix</li>\n<li>Emperor Spring Cup</li>\n<li>Champion Stakes</li>\n<li>St. Leger  (difficulty is now higher than the previous time)</li>\n<li>training</li>\n<li>Japan Cup</li>\n<li>Japan Grandprix (difficulty is this time higher than previously)</li>\n<li>The Arc The Triomphe</li></ul>\n\nThe game is identical to the original one in all of its fundamental aspects, save for a number of modifications to minor details: continues are still named \u00abcredits\u00bb (four of them are given: it is possible to select a different horse when continuing the game using a credit after game over) and their quantity is indicated, likewise in arcade games, at the bottom of the screen (although the flashing \u00abInsert coin\u00bb on the opening screen followed by \u00abPush P1 start !\u00bb has been replaced with \u00abPush P1 or P2 start !\u00bb).\n\nWhile the original game was entirely in Japanese (except for race names, given an English translation), the console version, despite not having been released outside of Japan, can be said to be in English (conversely, now race course names have a Japanese translation next to the English name); money prizes are now in dollars rather than in yen, and remarkably changed in value: whereas YPN 5300 were the reward in the arcade version, $540000 are awarded to the winner of a race. Initially, nothing but crossing the finish line in the first place allowed progression in the game; in the console conversion finishing in the first three places guarantees advancement to the next race.\n\nHorse energy is named \u00abpower\u00bb in the Neo Geo version, adhering to the original game, while in the Wii version it was renamed to \u00ablife\u00bb; furthermore, in the Neo Geo version the blue and red segments are shown inverted beside the energy bar. The console version presents fours levels of difficult: easy, normal, hard, MVS.",

The fighters are eight divine beings, gods struggling against one another to acquire power over the heaven. \n\nControls make use of all of the four buttons of the original Neo Geo arcade stick. Available moves, combat moves and combat actions are explained in a section preliminary to the game and are: punch, kick, dash and quick dash, jump, jump attack, throw, super throw, cushion throw (a throw that does nothing but invert the position of the fighters on the fighting field), counterattack, meter build up (the fighter can not move while charging the power meter: once that is done, a Super God move of gargantuan power can be released). It is possible to dash forward, and perform fight moves while on air for a time longer than normal, on account of the preterhuman nature of the battlers (the game is defined as \u00abaerial battle action game\u00bb in the spine of Neo Geo version package). Each divinity wields a personal weapon of medieval fashion, like for instance an imposing sword, a bow, a dreadful halberd.\nVictory goes to who prevails in 2 out of 3 rounds (the duration of each of which is 60 seconds), and a bonus score related with time and energy left is given to them.\n\nSlight gameplay alterations distinguish the Saturn game version.",

The players can lay down traps that explode in straight lines in four directions. The characters are also able to kick the traps out of their way. Power-ups sometimes appear, such as more powerful traps, landmines, and traps which can be detonated remotely. \n\nThere are four characters to choose from, each of which has slightly different stats. Each round lasts for a limited time, and - depending on the game mode (deathmatch or team deathmatch) - the winner is the player or the team with the highest score. ",

In <i>Nutjitsu</i> you take control of a ninja Squirrel, and navigate around a map crawling with samurai fox guards. Acorns periodically spawn around the map with different point values depending on their color and rarity. Collect as many acorns as possible before being caught to earn better rewards and higher scores.\n\nEach mission completed awards acoins. The acoins can be spent on power-ups such as speed boosts, decoys, smoke bombs, enemy freezing spells and one that will disintegrate any enemy it touches. In addition to the standard collect-all-you-can mode, there are several objective modes with interesting gameplay twists: lurker, collect scrolls, collect and deliver, collect a number, and collect a color. Each of these objectives can be played at varying difficulties ranging from very easy to extremely difficult.<ul>\n<li>Lurker is a king-of-the-hill mode in which magic areas spawn around the map. Stand in a zone to tick off time toward your objective.  Each zone will move after a certain time has been scored in it.</li><br>\n<li>In collect scrolls, scrolls appear around the map that will quickly disappear if not collected.  There is a target number that, once gathered, will end the round in victory.</li><br>\n<li>Collect and deliver has a sack on the map that is a delivery point for collected acorns.  Up to eight acorns can be gathered before making a delivery.  Once again, reaching the target number results in victory.</li><br>\n<li>Collect a number is a slight variation of standard gameplay in that the player simply has to collect a specific number of acorns in any fashion to achieve victory.</li><br>\n<li>Collect a color presents a specific color of acorn that must be collected.  This color changes on a timer throughout the round.  All colors can be collected for points but only acorns of the active color are counted toward the round's objective.  Once meeting the objective number, the round is complete.</li><br></ul>",

      "description": "<i>Crimsonland</i> is an enhanced version of the 2003 game Crimsonland. It is a top-down arcade arena shooter that is similar in design to the original game. The player controls a character that needs to survive in an arena against wave of enemies. Just like the original game there are various weapons and power-ups, but with an overhaul for the visual style.\n\nThere are two main game modes: Quests and Survival. Quests consists of six sets of ten levels that need to be completed one by one to progress. They have a fixed ending reached when a progression bar near the top is completely filled. By killing monsters the character gains experience and eventually unlocks about 30 weapons and 55 perks. There are three difficulty levels. Survival consists of five separate modes (Survival, Rush, Blitz, Weapon Picker, and Nukefism) each with their own rules for weapons and perks. Some start with an assault rifle, others let you pick weapons and perks at the beginning or after leveling up, or offer limited ammo, etc. In each of these modes the goal is to survive as long as possible without an ending.\n\nThe arenas are always slightly larger than a single-screen environment and enemies appear from all directions. The character can be moved around and can also shoot in any direction. The cross-hair counts down the remaining ammo and then the weapon needs to be reloaded. A blue circle surrounding the character shows the remaining health. Various power-ups and weapons can be picked up by destroying enemies, but only one weapon can be carried at all times. There are also bomb power-ups that destroy all enemies in the vicinity\n\nThe game has online leaderboards and supports four-player cooperative games in a local multiplayer mode.",

      "description": "<i>Q*bert: Rebooted</i> combines the original Q*bert arcade game (Classic) with a Rebooted version. The original version is identical to the initial arcade game. Players guide the character Q*bert as he needs to change all tiles on an isometric cube pyramid to a target colour to complete levels. Tiles are connected and have a maximum of four directions to hop to a new one. Each tile he lands on changes colour. Early stages have a limited amount of colours, but later ones require multiple hops to get the correct colour. Meanwhile he needs to dodge enemies (Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball) that also move around. There are also falling balls to avoid. Enemies can be lured off the pyramid by jumping on a floating disc near the side of the pyramid, causing them to fall off while Q*bert re-appears on the other side.\n\nThe Rebooted 3D game mode changes the tiles from squares to hexagons, offering six points of directions to move instead of the classic four. It also has a modern visual style with crisp graphics and smooth colours. This mode introduces thirty levels, seven new playable characters (Q*zard, Q*bertha, Q*bot, Q*zilla, Q*tee, Q*knight and Q*nicorn) and three new enemies (Homer, Uppercut and Treasure Chest). Completing levels in this mode is not enough to advance. It uses a three-star rating system where more than one star is needed to keep unlocking new levels. A star is awarded for completing a level, reaching a certain high score, and not exceeding the time limit. After each completed level a bonus level is played to earn gems. These are used to unlock the new characters, which differ only cosmetically. There are also various power-ups and traps.\n\nThe later released Xbox One version has five additional playable characters and a new soundtrack by EnV.",

      "description": "<i>1001 Spikes</i> is a difficult platformer designed with the retro aesthetics of an 8-bit game. It is an enhanced version of Aban Hawkins & 1000 Spikes. It was remade entirely with an improved visual style, more than twice the levels, redesigned levels, additional modes and additional characters. The protagonist is Aban Hawkins who explores different environment in search for his father, the archeaologist Jim Hawkins, and the treasure of Poko-Mum rumoured to be behind a golden door. He travels through Antarctica and South America with locations such as jungle, caverns and lava temples.\n\nThe title references the amount of lives the player has to complete the game. These are needed to complete the hard levels filled with enemies and traps such as spikes, boulders, falling platforms, crushing blocks, etc. \u2013 requiring a lot of trial and error. Basic controls consist of movement, a regular and a high jump, and an attack move (both melee and ranged). It is also possible to talk to characters at certain moments. A large amount of characters and additional costumes can be unlocked throughout the game, usually by discovering gold skulls in levels. Certain characters have specific abilities. The character Ninja Aban for instance is able to brief hold on to walls and perform a wall jump, Tina Hawkins (his sister) can cling to walls, and President Thompson has a double jump. Other characters are variants of Aban such as Soldier Aban and Slayer Aban (a nod to Castlevania), or characters from indie games such as Meat Boy (Super Meat Boy), Nyx (NyxQuest: Kindred Spirits), Curly Brace (Cave Story), Commander Video (Bit.Trip) and a large amount from Super Time Force. There are also references to classic games such as Ghost 'N Goblins' Sir Arthur's white armour, Nathan Drake (Uncharted) for the PlayStation version and Mr. Video Game (Mario) for the Wii U and 3DS version. Each character has its own story elements, but cannot be swapped on the fly or between levels; they each have their full campaign.\n\nSpikes are the common hazard to avoid and most levels have a key required to open the door that leads to the next level. For the first part of the game players have the ability to skip certain levels, but this locks off the second part of the campaign where this is disabled. That means that to complete the entire game, eventually all levels need to be completed, but it is possible to access a world map and return to any of them. The story mode contains 61 levels and the entire games has more than 100 levels. The game can locally be played cooperatively with up to four players and also in a versus mode. Next to the main story mode there are three arcade modes called The Golden Vase, Tower of Nannar, and The Lost Levels. The first is the versus mode where players fight each other to beat coins out of vase. These coins, also found in the story mode, can be spent in a shop for unlockables. The other two are additional campaigns for solo or cooperative play. The Vita and 3DS versions lack the arcade modes and multiplayer.",

The gameplay stays the same as the original with the player controlling little creatures that bounce around single screen levels with the aim of smashing gems. The gems are of various colours and therefore it's necessary to change the creature to the corresponding colour by hitting specific colour changing blocks. The player also has to avoid the skull blocks that kill the player upon contact. The most noticeable difference from the original is the new look with three dimensional graphics. Some minor differences in gameplay exist too. For instance there are no lives so the player can continue playing no matter how many skulls he touches.\n\nThe remake consists of the same story mode as the original game as well as a battle mode for two players but lacks the arcade mode from the Game Boy Advance version. New is a tutorial as well as extra special content that can be unlocked by progressing through the story mode. On Nintendo 3DS there is one exclusive mode, Color-Cade, which consists of 30 small and fast paced levels where the player rotates around a pillar while destroying rocks.",

      "description": "<i>Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions</i> is the fourth game in the arcade shooter series. It is made by a new developer, but with a large group of people who were involved with the previous games. The biggest novelty is the introduction of 3D environments, sometimes only aesthetically in actually flat environments, but also with complete 3D levels where the ship moves around a cube or globe in any direction.\n\nThe main game mode is called Adventure. It offers a level path with additional levels unlocked gradually and different game modes such as Boss (defeat the boss before time expires), Checkpoint (clear waves for extra time to reach the target score), Deadline (reach the target score before time runs out), Evolved (reach the target score with only three lives) and Titan (reach the target score with only one life). Each level has three targets based on performance to earn stars and these are required to keep unlocking new levels. In the boss mode for instance defeating the boss as quickly as possible is not sufficient, you need to get many kills in the provided time to reach a high score as well.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous games. The player controls a space ship with unlimited ammo that can be moved in any direction in a small arena. As in a twin stick shooter the ship can also shoot in any direction regardless of movement. Generally the goal is to survive as long as possible clearing waves of enemies. Defeated enemies leave behind green geoms that add to a score multiplier when collected. Sometimes a small group of objects spawns. When destroyed, a better default weapon is provided for a short time, such as rapid fire, more bullets or bullets that travel to different directions at once. Also returning is a limited amount of bombs that clear the entire screen, but without providing points.\n\nEntirely new to the series is a companion drone. By defeating bosses different drones are unlocked and a currency is earned by completing levels to upgrade them multiple times. The available drones are Attack, Collect, Defend, Ram, Snipe. They are controlled by the CPU and stay close to the player's ship, providing assistance in various ways. Next to bombs, five supers can be unlocked as additional weapons with limited ammo. They cover parts of the grid in small explosives, fire homing missiles, create a defensive black hole etc. Before starting a game one drone and one super can be selected.\n\nThe game modes of the previous games, available as single sessions, are available in a separate Classic mode. They are Deadline Classic, Evolved Classic, King Classic (no guns outside king zones), Pacifism Classic (no guns, move through barriers to destroy nearby enemies), and Waves Classic.\n\nThere are competitive game modes, both offline (up to four players) and online (up to eight players). In the Stock mode the first team to kill the boss wins. When time runs out instead, the team with the highest score wins. Personal ammo is limited to 50 bullets. Players need to collect ammo packets to gain more bullets and these can be shared between the team players. In the Summoner game mode the team with the highest score wins when time runs out. In this mode the ships need to shoot towers to spawn enemies the team can kill to receive points. The other team also attempts to claim towers however to have enemies spawn for them. In both game modes the multiplier is shared between all team members and if one member dies it is reset for everyone.\n\nIn March 2015 a free update was provided that renamed the game <i>Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions - Evolved</i>. It includes a new Ultimate mode with new levels, new game modes and grid shapes, a new sweep drone and detonator super, eight new enemy types, a new Hardcore mode with no drones allowed, Retro Evolved Classic as a new game type in the Classic mode, and a number of tweaks to the gameplay.",

      "description": "<i>BlazeRush</i> is an arcade racing game similar to Rock 'n Roll Racing. Races take place on short tracks with the camera positioned in a fixed, isometric-like view next to the track. As the camera stays fixed relative to the car, the controls need to be adjusted based on the position on the track. The game is set on three planets with sixteen tracks in total. During races there is no health; when knocked off the track the car automatically respawns. All racers are kept in view at all times. When one car lags behind it eventually respawns closer to the other racers.\n\nIn the career mode races need to be completed based on different game modes. There are regular circuit races, time trials, death races and king races. In death races races the cars are chased by a giant spiked steamroller. Every now and then it approaches, destroying all cars in the way until only one remains. Points are then awarded based on the position and there are multiple sessions until a survivor race is completed. When knocked off the track in a survivor race, the car does not respawn until the next session. King races are won by staying in the lead longer than the other racers, regardless of the ending position. By winning races points, cups and medals are earned. Cups are objectives specific for each track. By doing well additional tracks and racers are unlocked. Each racer has different statistics based on mass, acceleration and handleability. Slow cars have little acceleration, but are not affected much by projectiles. Fast cars have great acceleration, but are easily knocked off the track. There are also racers that slightly hover above the track.\n\nWhile racing various pick-ups spawn. There is a boost that can be activated by the player, either as a regular boost or different types of strong ones that can also easily catapult a car into the void. Weapon pick-ups include an autogun, a seeking missile, a chainsaw blade, a slime shot that slows down and a soundwave. As opponents cannot be destroyed permanently (except for survivor races), the main goal is to use weapons to knock opponents off the tracks and gain the lead. There is also a focus on drifting through corner and avoiding obstacles and the track borders. The game supports multiplayer for up to four players offline and eight players online.",

      "description": "<i>Pix the Cat</i> is a fast-paced game set in mazes using elements from Pac-Man and Snake. The protagonist is Pix the Cat, a character previously introduced in the game PIXEL! The game contains four different game modes. The main arcade mode consists of three environments (starter, main, dessert) unlocked gradually. The goal is to reach a high score with a limited amount of time. Pix moves at a constant speed and can be moved in any of four directions as long as there is no obstacle in the way. A single field contains eggs and marked spots. He needs to collect the eggs <i>Pac-Man</i>-style, which causes them to hatch as ducklings that trail behind him, similar to the tail in <i>Snake</i>. To get rid of them and to score he needs to bring them to the marked spots by moving over them, with a duckling removed for each spot.\n\nTo achieve a large score different types of mechanics are combined. A combo meter is filled up with up to four tiers (x2, x5, x10 and frenzy) as long as Pix does not run into walls, obstacles or his own trail of ducklings. When he gets stuck he immediately respawns, but the ducklings are lost as well as a part of the combo meter. The combo meter is also reduced if he releases ducklings on spots before all the eggs in a single area are collected, which causes them to crack, but the area can still be completed. An area can also be cleared perfectly for a larger score. When he approaches a wall or is about to get stuck the game slows down, shows escape route arrows and zooms in similar to the way it is done in Pac-Man: Championship Edition DX and he can also grind walls like in that game to quickly turn when it is possible. As the combo meter increases, the game's speed increases as well, making it possible to complete more of the game in the allotted time. In the highest combo tier called frenzy, skull enemies which otherwise harm Pix can be defeated similar to taking a power pill in <i>Pac-Man</i>, by headbutting them, for a large amount of points. Each combo tier introduces a different visual style. Each of the three worlds has a small amount of randomization for the environments, making sessions similar, but never entirely identical. After clearing an entire area an exit appears to go deeper into the maze and both the previous and the next part of the game are often kept in view, similar to the way it is done in Jumpman. It is also always possible to return to a previous maze through an exit, but new exits only appear when an area is completed. The game is not always shown in the same size, sometimes the previous maze is kept in view and the next one is shown as a very small environment next to it, with dynamic zoom. By reaching certain scores additional worlds are unlocked including a random daily arcade grid, as well as new companion voices and artwork.\n\nThe second game mode is called Laboratory. Here Pix needs to collect cells and deliver them similar to the Arcade mode. Pix no longer moves at a constant speed, but slides in a certain direction until an obstacle is encountered. It is more of a puzzle mode where the player is encouraged to complete a maze with a certain amount of moves to receive a bonus. It is stricter than the Arcade mode, as all cells need to be collected first before they are delivered or the level is failed immediately. Later levels introduce moving enemies that need to be avoided. The third game mode is shown in black-and-white and is called Nostalgia. With a visual design of those of silent films and early animation movies, it is a kind of survival mode. Pix collects eggs with a trail of ducklings similar to the Arcade mode, but does not need to deliver them. Instead he needs to collect a certain amount of eggs that keep spawning without getting stuck or running into enemies. Later levels become more complex, for instance having three different mazes with three cats controlled simultaneously. A bonus is provided for completing levels quickly.\n\nThe fourth game mode is a local multiplayer mode called Arena (not available on Vita). Up to four players control a Pixbot character on a single screen, but often with multiple mazes, grabbing eggs to create a trail. They need to ram each other and can use power-up eggs to receive a speed boost or shoot a projectile to stun another character or put down a mine. The more eggs in the trail, the slower a Pixbot moves. The goal is to become the last Pixbot standing. With three or more players in a game, knocked out players turn into ghosts that can still slowly move around the area. If a ghost manages to hit an active Pixbot, the ghost player is revived as a Pixbot and can continue playing.",

      "description": "<i>Mat Mania</i> is a wrestling game and the spiritual successor to Tag-Team Wrestling. The player controls a wrestler in a televised event broadcast by the fictional T.W.A. (Taito Wrestling Association in the US version, Technos Wrestling Association in the Japanese version). The wrestler needs to compete against five opponents in a fixed order: Insane Warrior (US) / Insane Worrier (Japan), Karate Fighter, Coco Savage, The Pirania and Golden Hulk (US) / Blues Bloody (Japan). When the five fights are completed successfully a champion belt is presented in a ceremony and then the five fighters needed to be defeated again, but then drawn in a random order.\n\nThe fighter can be moved in eight directions and only two actions are used to kick and punch. Pressing both buttons simultaneously makes the character run. Based on the position in the ring it is possible to sprint and launch from the ropes, pin a wrestler, get on the ropes, throw a wrestler out of the ring, perform ring jump attacks, holds, grabs, a should block, a headlock, an Irish wisp, a body slam, a piledriver, a vertical suplex, a back body drop, an elbow smash, a clothesline, a jumping kick, a body splash, a sunset flip and a knee drop, and throw the opponent into the environment, also out of the ring.\n\nVarious celebrities and comic book characters make cameos as part of the spectator crowd. The game supports two players taking turns. For the Sharp X68000 platform the game is available only in the compilation Video Game Anthology Vol. 8: Exciting Hour / Shusse \u014czum\u014d.",
