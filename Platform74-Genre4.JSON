      "description": "After the 20th century, humankind reaches its hand out across the stars. Seeking to escape the overcrowded chaos of Earth, the United Nations builds a single seedship, the UNS Unity, and sends her on a mission towards the Alpha Centauri star system. After a long journey in cryogenic suspension, the Unity reaches Alpha Centauri where the Captain is killed under mysterious circumstances. Suspecting the motives of one another, the officers and the crew split into 7 factions, each lead with a distinct ideology and motives that they seek to build the planet in their image...\n\n<i>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</i> is best compared to Civilization II, but features many distinct differences in gameplay and thinking. In Civilization, the objective was to evolve a society from primitive tribes, whereas Alpha Centauri starts with the landing of colony pods on a barren planet with society becoming fractured. Each faction (aka nation) receives it's own share of the Unity's resources and tech base. For the basics, bases produce nutrients, materials and energy. Nutrients are required to feed to population, Materials are used in production and energy represents the commerce effect which can be traded to players diplomatically or spent on improvements. The 7 factions each have their own agenda, which is determined in large part by the Social Engineering. This enables a faction to customize its values, earning a bonus for what it considers important and a penalty for what it doesn't. Social Engineering system are discovered through research, the same as other improvements, such as structures and units.\n\nResearch is divided into 4 types of technologies, which form an intertwining tree of dependencies. They are: Conquer (direct military applications), Explore (indirect technologies for units and bases), Build (direct infrastructure application) and Discovery (Science for the sake of science, indirect applications). Because of the separation, factions can focus on what they hope the intended result of their science will be, and can be changed at any time. To explore the planet, units are needed. Any unit can be customized out of known technologies; consisting of a chassis type, reactor, weapon, armor and special abilities. Each of these components has a different expense, with untested technologies having additional overhead (prototype). \n\nFinally, Alpha Centauri is not a desolate star system. There is life on the planet, in the form of alien fungus that litters the ground and strange creatures such as mindworms. Initially hostile to all factions, this form of life holds its own secrets and effects on the world at large.\n",

      "description": "Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.\n\nThere are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.\n\nCombat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.\n\nThere are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.",

      "description": "<i>The Ancient Art of War</i> is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.  \n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\n<ul><li>The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\n<li>The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).</ul>\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.",

Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). \n\nThe game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different. ",

      "description": "<i>Archon: The Light and the Dark</i> is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\n<i>Archon</i> can be played with either one or two players.\nThe NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.",

      "description": "Myth: The Fallen Lords is a Real Time Strategy game which pits the evil Fallen Lords vs humanity.\r\n\r\nYou must take control of archers, explosive-throwing dwarves, dependable infantry, and others to stop the horde of undead and evil from overrunning the last vestiges of good in the world. Battle plague-ridden corpses who detonate themselves in ground-shaking explosions, throngs of axe-wielding zombies, floating spectors who hurl poisoned spears at you, and quick-moving magical creatures armed with sharp blades. Live long enough and you will face the most powerful of the Fallen Lords.\r\n\r\nTake control of the high ground and your ranged attackers will be able to shoot farther distances, but the enemy can take advantage of the same situation. Sometimes it may be to your advantage to let the forces of evil thin their ranks for you...\r\n\r\nGo online and play vs other humans, using either side you wish, in many modes of play, including a game of capture the flag, but with a ball instead.",

The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.\n\nAfter a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.\n\nIn addition to the basic 'build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may  engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.

Created by the Ancients, it remains unclaimed due to a powerful Guardian that orbits the planet and keeps out intruders. These same Ancients long ago fought a war against the Antarans and banished them into another dimension. Now... long after the Ancients empire has vanished, new races take to the stars, wishing to establish their own star empires, defeat the Antarans and become... The Master of Orion.\n\n<i>Master of Orion II: Battle At Antares</i> is a turn-based 4x space empire game and is the sequel to Master of Orion, reinterpreting that game from scratch. Unlike the original the game can be played single player or with other human players. The player takes the role of a ruler of one of thirteen races, while also having the extra option of creating a custom one. They must manage planet resources to build ships and facilities, improving production. Exploration of the galaxy is done via scouts and colony ships, which can establish new planets as part of the empire. Research must also be done to discover and utilize new technologies. Alien civilizations which are encountered can be negotiated with, or ships can engage in combat in a turn-based grid system. As new systems are explored, random events are triggered and strange artifacts found in orbit around unexplored planets.

      "description": "<i>The Ancient Art of War at Sea</i> is the sequel to the Ancient Art of War, where the battle campaigns now takes place in the vast oceans of naval combat.\n\nThe game is a top-down semi real-time strategy game. The game has different speed/time settings (slower to faster), hence the player may  manage strategies while remaining in real-time mode. As its predecessor, the game comes with different difficulty settings, symbolized by several famous naval commanders and also comes with a game editor.\n\n<b>Ship Types</b><br>\nAs its predecessor, the game introduces three different types of units in the game:<br><br>\n<ol><li>The frigate, small but fastest ship in the fleet.</li>\n<li>The ship-of-the-line, the primary battleship in the fleet.</li>\n<li>The flagship, well armed but slow. Flagships are the moving strategic flags that need to be captured in order to win the game.</li></ol>\nThe aim of the game is to capture all the enemy flagships while protecting flagships under the player's control. As added difficulty, new ships cannot be built, however enemy ships may be captured by boarding them.\n\n<b>Main Map</b><br>\nThe main map provides information regarding friendly and enemy unit location, ports, and certain waters that may cause damage to ships that cross it. Reparations and supplies may be obtained in the many ports provided on the main map. Whether or not supplies or reparations may take place depend on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCertain types of waters may be dangerous for ships to sail across. There are two different types of waters: shallow waters and dangerous waters. The larger the ship, usually the more damage they take when they cross those seas. This however also depends on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\n<b>Combat</b><br>\nSea combat enters a top down tactical map, where the player can control several ships at once. During sea combat, the aim of the game is to sink the opposing fleet by firing cannons or by boarding and capturing the ship.\n\nWhen to ships collide with each other, the combat screen enters the boarding screen. There are two different units provided when boarding:  swordsmen (pirates with cutlasses, for melee) and musketeers (ranged combat). The winner is the last man standing. Certain ports provide different type of pirate units, however this is not explicitly mentioned within the game.",

The player has to make it work by managing heaven and hell simultaneously.\n\nIn both hell and heaven the player constructs zones which deal with one of the seven capital sins respectively the corresponding virtues. Through the gates new souls arrive regularly which were sinful or virtues in one specific aspect. These go to the appropriate zones to receive their gifts or punishment - but only if the player constructed a street system. If there is no place left they wander through hell/heaven which is of course bad for business. After some time they get sent back to the home planet. These souls are the source of the player's income. \n\nOf course these facilities also need personnel. These can be either hired or trained by building special training facilities. There are also additional things the player has to keep in mind, e.g. the satisfaction of each soul and the energy supply. Every buildings has to be micro-managed by adjusting their settings but there is also the possibility to use a tool which does it automatically - for a price. \n\nRandom disasters like \"Birds of Paradise\" (excrement rain down on the facilities) break the economic circle and challenge the player to repair the damage. Besides the free playing mode there are also five scenarios where the player has to solve certain tasks.",

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once). \n\nEach mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.",

Where it differs is in being set in space.\n\nThe planet Orion itself is a lush, fertile planet with vast mineral resources. It is guarded by the Guardian - a powerful vessel which you have to defeat in order to plunder Orion's riches.\n\nAs you attempt to expand your empire, you will have to trade and steal technologies form rivals, again much like <i>Civ</i>. Your ships can be improved over the game, in terms of engine power, shields, cloaking devices and weapons, and different combinations of these can be integrated. Resource management is largely set using sliders, which reduces the amount of time spent on micro-management.",

This game lets you choose from 6 different \"ages\" (for example, \"The Silver Empire\" from 1560-1600, \"War For Profit\" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. \n\nThe goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of \"evil Spaniards\" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  \n\nThe game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land.",

You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! \n\nYou must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction. The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  ",

However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...\n\nChris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mails asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.\n\nThe result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:\n<ol>\n<li>The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.\n\n<li>18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.\n\n<li>A \"Crisis Advisory Board\" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises. The nice thing about being a Superpower is that the little countries do whatever you tell them, but you still have to watch out for your main rivals (USSR or the US)!\n</ol>",

      "description": "<i>Hodj N' Podj</i> is a series of mini-games that can either be played against the computer or against another player.\n\nThe game is designed as a computerised board game in which two princes, Hodj and Podj, travel around the country of Po-Poree solving puzzles in an attempt to rescue two princesses Mish and Mosh. There are three game modes, the board game, the individual mini games, or the 'Grand Tour'.\n\nBoard game mode: The player always controls Hodj, while Podj can be controlled either by the second player or by the computer. In this mode the objective is to locate the kidnapped princesses and get them back to their castle. A game spinner determines how many squares/furlongs the player can move around the board, there are also boats, skycars and shortcuts which speed up travel between distant points.\n\nTo win, the game players must collect a specific number of objects and pieces of information, Appendix A of the manual explains which game is in which location and whether the reward is crowns, information or an item. The number to be collected depends upon the type of game the player(s) are playing; short: around thirty minutes; medium: around an hour; or long: up to two hours. The required objects are not necessarily earned directly, some objects needed will have to be bought usually by selling unwanted items in the pawn shop and using the cash in one of the two in-game stores.\n\nWhen one player knows where the princesses have been taken and has the appropriate quantities of goods and information they go to the ladies locations and then head for the castle. Along the way the other player can intercept and issue a challenge, win or lose further challenges can be issued by either player until one enters the castle with Mish and Mosh top win the game.\n\nThis game mode has three difficulty settings and when playing a two player game the difficulty can be set separately for each player. \n\nMini Game mode: There nineteen games in all and all can be played separately from the board game if desired and when played in this way the player has access to configuration options that are not available in Board game mode. All games have rules which are both displayed on-screen and read aloud in a very British accent. \n\nThe mini games are;<ul>\n<li>Archeroids: a sideways version of a <i>Space Invader</i> game</li>\n<li>Art Parts: a jigsaw puzzle game</li>\n<li>Barbershop Quintet: A solitaire game played with an unusual deck of cards</li>\n<li>Battlefish, inspired by Battleship</li>\n<li>Beacon: a colour based puzzle</li>\n<li>Cryptograms: literally decrypt the code on the crypt</li>\n<li>Dam Furry Animals: a whac-a-mole game</li>\n<li>Fuge: a circular breakout game</li>\n<li>Garfunkel: a game similar to <i>Simon</i></li>\n<li>Th Gesng Gam: a bit like <i>Jeopardy</i>, guess the word/phrase before time runs out</li>\n<li>Life: this version is based on villages and economy instead of cells</li>\n<li>Mancala: the African strategy game</li>\n<li>Maze o' Doom: find your way out of a maze</li>\n<li>No vacancy: a dice game</li>\n<li>Pack Rat: inspired by Pac-Man</li>\n<li>Peggleboz: a peg solitaire game</li>\n<li>Poker: a video poker game</li>\n<li>Riddles: a timed puzzle where the player must solve the riddle and type in the answer</li>\n<li>Word Search: a timed puzzle where all the words relate to a specific theme</li>\n</ul>\n\nGrand Tour Mode: In this mode the player plays eighteen of the nineteen games, poker is the one that's not available, in alphabetic, geographic or random order. As with the Board game the player undertakes the grand Tour in any of the three difficulty settings and if two players are taking the 'Tour they can do so using separate difficulty levels..",

It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.\n\nThe gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.\n\nYou can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.  ",

The control system involves selecting units with the mouse and then directing them, while the opponents make their moves without waiting for a \"turn\" to end.\n\nThe game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. The player can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.\n\nIn most missions, a base needs to be built first in order to build new units and structures. Most important are the harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money, thus funding the construction of a base and an army.\n\nThe game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.\n\nA Windows 95 version was released later and is found here.",

Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.\n\nGameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. \n\nThere's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.\n\nThere are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed. ",

Touch the \"flag\" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.\n\nThe game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don't really need to micromanage each soldier. \n",

      "description": "The political situation in the democratic monarchy of Arulco has gone from bad to worse. The country has been taken over through a coup d'\u00e9tat by Queen Deidranna Reitman, the wife of Enrico Chivaldori - rightful heir and son of late King Andreas Chivaldori. Enrico was reportedly killed in an assassination attempt during his trial for the murder of his father. Enrico however is alive and has contacted the Association of International Mercenaries (A.I.M.) to help him retake the island. Making contact with Miguel Cordoba, the head of the resistance team, A.I.M. will hire mercenaries and coordinate battle plans to control towns, organize militias in a quest to overthrow Queen Deidranna.\n\n<i>Jagged Alliance 2</i> is an isometric, third-person perspective turned-based strategy game. The role-playing elements of the game refer to (mostly) character development. The game is also able to switch between two different styles: sci-fi or realistic modes. From a new game, players will use their laptop to review information and hire mercenaries. Following that, the political map shows a satellite top-down position of the island of Arulco. From the map, equipment and funds are managed, as well as a review of enemy movement, and planning can be made to capture towns, mines and other locations. From the map, mercenaries can be deployed into a specific sector. Hostile sectors and enemy counter-attacks initiate combat mode.\n\nThe combat screen is where most of the actual gameplay occurs. Traveling in towns, exploring houses (with the purpose of stealing stuff of course!) and most importantly combat, occurs here. An encounter with an enemy team (either offensive or defensive) will prompt a battle in the area of contact. If on the offensive, players may opt to place mercenaries in favorable positions. Each team plays in turns, unless their action in interrupted by an opposing member. Enemies come in all shapes and sizes: enemy soldiers, tanks, bloodcats, and (in sci-fi mode) insect-like monsters. The team that remains alive will control the sector.\n\nIn order to recapture the island, players must engage in town militia management. A defense system must be organized for newly conquered towns to defend against enemy troops. Only loyal towns however may have its population trained into militia (indicated by a green percentage on the town via political map). A maximum of 2 mercenaries may train militia in any given town. The militia has 3 different training levels: green, regular, and veteran. The first 2 may be acquired through training, while the veteran status may only be acquired through combat.",

      "description": "<i>Sid Meier's Colonization</i> is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition\nfrom other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.\n\nThe game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American\nRevolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your\ncolonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.\n\nEach of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. \n\nThe cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. \n\nYou'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. \n\nAs you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some \"places of interest\" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). \n\nTo defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. \n\nAs you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce \"Liberty Bells\", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won! ",

      "description": "The Kingdom of Azeroth was relatively peaceful and ruled by King Llane. That was until a powerful mage named Medivh commanded forces that opened up a portal in the Swamp of Sorrow, leading to another world. This ushered in the Age of Chaos, as Orcs were summoned to this world and attempted to establish an empire. As the Orcish hordes swarmed from the portal, they met with the Humans of Azeroth and battles ensured. Peaceful co-existence is not an option. Only one race will attain dominance over the land.\n\n<i>Warcraft: Orcs & Humans</i> is the first real-time fantasy strategy game from  Blizzard Entertainment. By playing either the Humans or the Orcs in this saga, two separate story lines evolve with 12 scenarios per side telling the tale of the battle for Azeroth. Players must mine gold and chop wood in order to construct buildings and create new units. From swords to sorcery, all the elements of classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and Necromancers who are able to raise the dead.\n\nThe multiplayer aspects of the game allow 2 players to challenge one another on over 20 custom maps and determine who is the supreme warlord. Head to head play is supported over modem, serial link, and IPX networks, and works cross-platform between the IBM-PC and Macintosh versions.",

      "description": "In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy.  Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace.  But a previously unknown species, the Zerg, has started overrunning their colonies.  Furthermore, a second alien species, the enigmatic Protoss, became intent on stopping the Zerg.  The Protoss solution, however, is to extinguish all life on Zerg-infested planets, including many surviving resident Terrans.  At the same time, rebel factions within the Terran government are gaining popular support during the Zerg crisis.  The time for war has come!\n\nGameplay in <i>StarCraft</i> has clear similarities to Blizzard's earlier <moby game=\"Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness\n.\">WarCraft II.  Building units requires credits and a power source, and once completed you can direct them into combat against foes.  You only know the layout of terrain you have visited, and only the exact whereabouts of enemy units which are range for one of your units, due to the Fog of War. \n\nEach of the three races has a distinct range of units and general strengths: Zerg units are quick to build, Terran units cost the least, and Protoss units are the most powerful individually.  In a change from many strategy games, the base style for each race also varies significantly, resulting in a very different playing experience with each.  Missions vary from destruction to infiltration.  Realistic line-of-sight calculations make the correct result more likely.  A full map editor is provided, with many user-created maps available online.",

The game allows the player to advance through the Ages: The Paleolithic (old Stone Age), the Neolithic (new Stone Age, or the Tool Age), the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. If the player would rather get away from the historical aspect, the game offers a random terrain generator and a custom scenario builder. \n\nThe game has four resources: food, obtained by either hunting, foraging, fishing, or farming; wood, which must be logged by hand; stone, which must be mined; and gold, which can either be mined or obtained through trade with other players.\n\nAs a real-time war game, <i>Age of Empires</i> naturally revolves around gathering resources and producing units.",

      "description": "<i>Warlords II</i> is a 2D turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. The player is a commander from one of several races (like the people from the Kingdoms, the Dark Elves, Ussyrian Orcs, Sirians etc.). The player starts with one city, and must capture other cities (enemy or neutral) to produce new units. The creation of a new unit itself takes a certain amount of turns. The player organizes warriors into \"armies\" (groups of units, shown as one icon on the map, like the heroes in the Heroes of Might and Magic series) and lead them into battles. The units differ in the number of movement points they possess, but the armies are only as fast as the slowest unit in them. Battles are resolved automatically, the player cannot affect them.",

You control a power-suit with arm-mounted weapons: just aim (with mouse) and shoot, while move completely independently (using keyboard). \n\nYou can choose from multiple types of suits (scout, regular, heavy), multiple types of weapons (everything from simple lasers to railguns to missile launchers), multiple assistance modules (from mine layer to auto-doc), and up to three squadmates that'll follow your orders. You are pitted against enemies from pirates to tanks and mechs, even psycho clones and armed drones. Missions vary from attack and recon to rescue and defend, across three different planets in a variety of weather and terrain. \n\nSimilarly to Wing Commander 3, the game features full-motion video sequences.",

      "description": "<i>Civilization</i> has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. \n\nIf you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. \n\nThere are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). \n\nNot all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. \n\nScientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. \n\nHow your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism. ",

      "description": "<i>Veni, Vidi, Vici</i> is the sequel of the well-known Settlers game. You start your settlement with only one main building. To build any other buildings, you first must find a source for stones and wood. So you start to build little roads where your men transport all the different goods along. There exist more than 30 different professions your men can have, and many different building types. Of course, there are other settlers in your area, too, so war is unavoidable.\n\nThe graphics are now in SVGA, and the soundtrack is available as CD-Audio or MIDI.",

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.\n\nEach god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.\n\nWhen you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.\n\nBut you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. \n\nAnd when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.",

      "description": "<i>Heroes of Might and Magic</i> is a turn-based strategy game in which the player takes on the role of one of four different heroes: the warlock, sorceress, barbarian, or knight. As the hero the player must build up his or her castle by adding different buildings to earn different units to strengthen the hero's army with. Units include dragons, cyclopes, phoenixes, paladins, and many more fantasy creatures. Bulidings and units cost money and resources. Buildings can also be upgraded to unlock new unit types.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is exploring the world and discovering treasures, spells, mines to gather resources, nomad camps, magic lamps, ultimate artifacts, and more. The game uses a top down map in which the player can move his heroes a number of spaces each turn. Whenever the player encounters an enemy hero or castle a battle is shown in a close-up view.\n\nDuring battles all the player's units are shown as stacks. The player can move these stacks around on a hexagonal grid. Different units have different movement and attack capabilities requiring different strategies to use and overcome.\n\nThe goal is to defeat all opponents by conquering their castles and defeating their heroes in battle. The player must also defend his own castles from enemy attacks. The player's heroes can collect spells to use in battle and can boost the units under their command, but they otherwise don't have a presence on the battlefields. The heroes collect experience points in typical RPG manner which boosts their stats. In addition items can be collected for additional bonuses.\n\n",

There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.\n\nHowever, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they <i>are</i> sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.\n\nAs levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.",

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.\n\nShops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n\nYou are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n\nIt can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.",

A virus has wiped out its crew, but the threat of it firing its <i>Iron Helix</i> doomsday weapon is still there. You must remotely pilot an unarmed science robot to explore the ship and work out how to shut the weapon down.\n\nThe game uses interactive quarter-screen footage to display the ship's interiors. The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.\n\nAs you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.\n",

      "description": "<i>Deadlock: Planetary Conquest</i> is a 2D turn-based 4X strategy. Players take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists, ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding, and ultimately warring. The planet's surface is divided into smaller areas. Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres. Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents' satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest and don't work.\n\nThe battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies. The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres first.",

      "description": "<i>Across the Rhine: 1944 - 1945 Armored Combat in Western Europe</i> is a mix between strategy and simulation game set during WWII. The game focuses on single tank battles during the Allied invasion of Normandy - this means the player can't influence the overall outcome of the war. The battles are mostly historically accurate but some of them use hypothetical situations.\n\nThe basic situation however is always the same: the player is in charge of tank battalions and tries to defeat his enemy. The player is presented with several windows which show different information, e.g. a tactical map, a strategical map or a battlefield from a tank's view. The size and position of these windows can be freely arranged. From these windows he also gives orders to his tanks, e.g. assigning waypoints or changing the behaviour. All this is in real-time. The player has also the opportunity to directly take control over a tank - there he has the choice between several viewpoints, including the driver's or gunner's view, and controls movement and turret. Optionally the AI can take care of the movement. This part of the game is more simulation than action game.\n\nDuring the three campaigns the player takes control over both parties. He assembles a soldier which, depending on the battle performances, gets promoted during the course of the game which results in the command over more units. There are also many options to set the realism of the game in different areas, e.g. manual fuel distribution, limited ammo, morale, air support or even invulnerability. ",

      "description": "Play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world. Another goal is to provide the impetus for a chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.\n\nThe main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for commuter trains.\n\nAs the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. The player may also build own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.  \n\nThe stock market is also another way of making money. The player may also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the New Year.",

The game starts with a Federation outpost detecting an unknown ship approaching Federation space; the Enterprise is sent to deal with this new situation. The mystery ship appears to be a small scout-ship from Garid that has lost power to its engines and as a result has sailed off of its intended course. Suddenly, a Romulan Warbird battleship from Garid uncloaks itself right between the protagonist and the new ship, and thus a new story begins.\n\n<i>A Final Unity</i> is a hybrid game with adventure and strategy segments. Whilst on the ship the player can use the tactical console to engage in occasional battles against enemy, repair damaged systems, and select teams for away missions. These missions constitute the larger portion of the game, and are played like a traditional point-and-click adventure, including item manipulation and puzzle-solving. Dialogues may vary depending on the crew members previously selected by the player.",

You have to hold on to your counties by building larger castles and keeping the peasantry happy and well-fed.\n\nWhen you engage your enemy in battle is when the real fun starts.  You are given a Warcraft-type view of the battlefield with the units in your army and have to either get them to retreat (a rarity) or kill every last one of the little buggers.  In a siege, you can end the battle by capturing the enemy's flag or dispatching all of your opponents soldiers to the great big Realm in the sky.\n",

Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).\n\nThe game's quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with \"circled\" animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.\n\nA turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the \"General\" name.",

      "description": "In this turn-based strategy game, based on the role-playing game Rune Quest, you take control of a clan of Orlanthi (somewhat resembling iron age Scandinavians) in the magical world of Glorantha. Yours and many other clans have recently migrated to Dragon Pass, a rich and fertile yet vastly unexplored valley. You try to survive and thrive in this environment however you can, your basic means being crops, livestock, hunting, trade, war and exploration. You can raid or fight the other Orlanthi clans, trade and ally with them and explore the wilderness around you. As resources you have the land you live on, goods your craftsmen create, rare commodities that can be found via exploration as well as horses, cattle, sheep and pigs. Your clan consists of trained warriors, artisans and farmers.\n\nThe game is split into five seasons each generally allowing the player two actions, but also restricting them: Exploration during the dark season is not advisable and your clan will usually refuse to wage war during harvest time. Additionally you will be presented with many random events which will force you to make decisions. Every decision has its consequences and even the most trivial choice will have repercussions over time. \n\nThe clan is ruled by a Council of seven that advises the player on most decisions. The council is chosen from a group of potential candidates (basically your nobility); Picking your councilmen and -women according to their abilities and the gods they worship is crucial. Just as crucial is determining who to listen to in a given situation. A great warrior may not be a good advisor on trade and diplomacy, just as a healer may not be adept at matters of war. If a council member causes too much trouble you may have to remove or even outlaw him or her. There are other reasons for reorganizing the council, the most obvious one being the death of a member.\n\nGoals of the game, other than mere survival and building a strong, rich clan, are relearning and reenacting all the myths of your gods (called performing a heroquest), forming a tribe from several clans and eventually uniting all tribes into a Kingdom under your leadership.\n\nThe game consists entirely of still images and selection screens, with a considerable amount of storytelling, requiring the player to read quite a bit. Player interaction is mostly limited to choosing by point and click.",

As sovereign, you can invest incentives (i.e. gold) to heroes which may encourage them to complete tasks you assign. You can indirectly control them by setting gathering points to various spots on the map. Units then try to reach these points and will automatically choose the right action to do at this spot once they're there, e.g. fighting monsters, harvest food or mine resources.",

      "description": "<i>Fantasy General</i> is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world with some steampunk/high-tech elements. \n\nThe forces of evil, in the form of the dreaded Shadowlord and his henchmen, have conquered most of the world. On the brink of defeat, the player (in the form of one of four heroes) is summoned as champion who will change course, free the world and defeat evil - or lose all.\n\nThe game features 10 unit types from four realms with lots of upgrades, complemented by a similar plethora available primarily to the opponent. Most of the game takes place on battle maps. Outside of those there's just a bit of basic recruiting, setting research priorities and financial managing. Battle maps are hex-based and feature lots of different terrain types that require a suitable approach - cavalry will rule on plains but is crippled in swamps. The player should build an army that is composed of the right mix of units and can adapt to new situations.\n\nThe game will look similar to players familiar with Panzer General since it uses a modified engine of said game.\n\nThe game offers two modes: the campaign against the Shadowlord or arena mode (single battle) against a computer or human opponent.\n\nIn campaign mode, the player selects one of four heroes, each with his or her special abilities and sets out to defeat the Shadowlord. The player must prove his or her own ability to adapt play style and army across five continents with different challenges until the player finally defeats the Shadowlord on Fire Isle.",

Each game can consist of seven or twenty-one question rounds. Pressing a key that acts like a \"buzzer,\" each player tries to be the first to answer a trivia question that pops on the screen. Many questions are humorously structured, drawing inspiration from pop culture references. The game's \"host\" provides jocular commentary during the show.\n\nThe sequel adds new gameplay modes: <i>DisOrDat</i>, in which players have to quickly classify words into two or more categories; <i>Celebrity Collect Calls</i>, which features real-life characters asking bizarre questions; and <i>Picture Questions</i>, which adds pictures to the predominantly sound-oriented game.

Questions are arranged in categories and all have a time limit. The player will find multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and other special situation questions such as rhyming, jumbled words, as well as sound and picture questions. The final question is always the <i>Jack Attack</i> which is matching up words that fit the clue.\n\nThis third installment of the series adds new categories, questions, and features.",

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.",

Each system you get can also contribute to research, which will allow you to build more powerful and less resource-intensive ships. Your objective is, of course, to be the sole ruler of the the \"galaxy\". The game, as the cover shows, has a completely \"Western\" theme, where the planets wear bandannas and cowboy hats.",

Fearing the worst, she assembles a military fleet as her escort. Arriving on the coast of Erathia, Catherine finds an allied wizard's tower, devastated from battle and abandoned. There she learns Erathia is falling to its enemies. Mustering local armies, Catherine marches to Erathia's capitol, restoring lost land along the way. Rescuing Erathia's besieged capitol, Catherine learns her father was poisoned with a goblet of wine. Setting herself up as queen, Catherine goes to war to restore Erathia's borders and discover her father's murderer. In the course of war, in an attempt to counter Catherine's recent successes, her enemies resurrect her buried father as an undead lich and make him general of their armies. Fighting her dead father's undead armies on the battlefield, Catherine continues her murder investigation and learns one of her most trusted generals was responsible. At the war'sconclusion, Catherine and her armies surround the last standing. Battling to the throne room, Catherine and her generals come face-to-face with Erathia's former king, now their undead enemy. From her assembled generals, Catherine points out the traitor. The undead king attacks and kills his murderer as Erathia's allied generals stand by and watch. Hunched over the dead body of his killer, the lich turns to the woman he named Catherine and once called daughter. Using a spell book, Catherine summons a lightning bolt from the sky and destroys her undead father. Sitting to the throne of her vanquished enemy, Catherine speaks, \"Rest in peace father.\"\r\n\r\nBetter graphic, more colors, amazing animations, louder music, and same controls. The battle for lands continues, with different story and more units, spells and characters to use.",

There are a multitude of creature types, from griffins to rocs, golems to pikemen, unicorns to hydras, and four different dragons. Each castle type has six different creatures, from the weak to the strong. There are six castle types, each corresponding to a hero class: Knight, Sorceress, Wizard (Good side), Barbarian, Necromancer and Warlock (Evil side). There are also six different types of neutral creatures you can recruit in special structures scattered about the maps.\n\nCompared to the first game, this sequel has larger and more interactive combat screens. The spell system is now based on spell points instead of spell memorization.\n\nThe maps themselves range from small two player maps, to huge maps that all six player types could fit in easily. There is a map maker included, and you can multiplay via hotseat, modem, or IP.",

      "description": "<i>Caesar III</i> is a city building game, in which you place building and lay out zones. You are in charge of a small province, and hope to make it as peaceful and prosperous as possible, following the advice of your citizens to make it work. The game also features defending your city, by forming an army. and for trade, but you never leave your city. You must pay attention to the Gods, who can inflict disasters if not satisfied. As the game progresses, new technologies become available, which you must allow for.\n\nIt is about people and systems. Each building that you build requires you to hire people; people that you see walking the streets of your town. The marketplace needs saleswomen, and buyers. You see the buyers walk to your granary to buy food, which they then bring back to granary. The sales lady walks up the street selling food to the houses she finds, which allows them to evolve to better housing, which pay higher taxes. The people in this game make the difference. Instead of a police station having a radius of effectiveness, it sends out a police officer who can only fight crime and fires he sees. The need to rely on randomly walking citizens means placement of buildings is as significant as in Serf City/The Settlers.",

You also have to connect all the little villages in the province with roads and make some industry, like stone mining, grapes, etc. for which you can then create markets in your city. \n\nWhen you have achieved the necessary requirements, you'll be able to start all over again in a new and more challenging province.

      "description": "<i>Seven Cities of Gold</i> (7COG), Commemorative Edition, is a PC remake of the classic game designed by Dan and Bill Bunten for the Atari and Commodore 64 computers.  You play an explorer commissioned by the King and Queen of Spain to voyage to a new world, claim land for the Crown, negotiate with (or conquer) the natives, and gain fame and fortune for yourself.  Between voyages, you'll have to buy and outfit ships and hire men to crew them.  As in the original <i>7COG</i>, you can play at three different skill levels, and choose to explore either the historical map (consisting of the Americas at the time of Columbus' journeys) or a land form randomly generated by the game.\r\n\r\nAs befitting a \"Commemorative Edition,\" the PC version of <i>7COG</i> has been beefed up with hi-res graphics and digitized sound.  <i>7COG</i> is a rare example of a game being completely redeveloped for a specific platform instead of merely being ported over.  <em>(However, Seven Cities of Gold did in fact come out natively for the PC in the mid 1980s.  --Ed.)</em>",

      "description": "<i>Pizza Tycoon</i> is a strategy game where you are an aspiring pizza chef, who wants to start the best pizza chain in the world. You begin by choosing a character you want to be (they differ in appearance and abilities, but the most important factor is the amount of money they have at the start). \n\nThen you choose one of the cities in the USA or Europe, where you will rent the building that will become your first pizza restaurant. Before you open it, however, you have to buy furniture, decor and floors (there's a huge choice); hire some cooks and waiters; add some pizzas to your menu, and buy ingredients (you can buy at various shops, which offer various quality of the ingredients). Once this is all ready, you can open your first restaurant and then advertise it via fliers, billboards, newspaper or TV ads. \n\nCreating your own pizzas, either to include into your menu or to take part in pizza-making competitions, is an important part of the game. You begin with an empty dough, and you're free to add a lot of various vegetables, meat, fruits or herb onto it. Remember that various people like various ingredients - if your restaurant is in a district populated mostly by kids, you can expect that a pizza made of sweet things will be popular. Also, specific ingredients rise and fall in popularity; if the newspaper announces that pineapples are bad for health, then sales of your Pineapple Pizza might plummet!\n\nBut while earning money as a honest citizen can be fun, it's even more exciting to get involved with the Underworld and buy weapons to devastate your competitor's restaurant, or do missions for the Mafia (which usually involve picking up something at a specific place at a specific time, and bringing it somewhere else at a different time). But beware, as this can bring you problems, either from the law or from the Mafia itself. ",

You have to reach 7,000 points to petition the Pope for the throne, and then you have to maintain those points for 4-5 game months to win the game. However, your rivals will attack you as soon as the Pope declares his support, so be sure you have a strong military before applying for the Papal backing.\n\nCastle building is more efficient and easier to deal with. You can also set up pre-made castles on file so that you can place them quickly. Battles are set in a full alternate screen with the ability to place and command each unit.",
