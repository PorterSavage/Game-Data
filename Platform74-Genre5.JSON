Choose from three classes of bike (125, 250 and 500cc), and between 8 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, France,England and Sweden) and 15 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, Western Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Holland, Belgium, France, England, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Brazil) original tracks depending on the version, at five difficulty levels (with the lower ones offering automatic gear changes). \n\nThe player can enter single races (always including qualifying) or complete in a full season. The action is viewed from the handlebars of your bike, a novelty for motorcycle racing at the time. The game engine is similar to that used by Grand Prix Circuit, but now incorporates hills.",

The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.\n\nApart from the Bush Hill course the game comes with <i>Famous Course Disk Volume I</i> which includes:\n<ul>\n<li>St Andrews, Scotland, UK</li>\n<li>Pebble Beach, California, USA</li>\n<li>Augusta National, Georgia, USA</li>\n</ul>\nA unique feature for the day was the Course Architect, which was quite versatile with practice.\n\nBeginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Beginner/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. ",

The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them. \n\nYou progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between.

The courses provided include real locations: St. Andrews (Scotland), Cypress Creek and Doral Country Club (USA) and a fictional one, The Gauntlet, which, as the name suggests, is designed to push the player's skills to the maximum.\n\nThe PC version utilizes the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via the company's patented <i>RealSound</i> process. Quips like \"No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap\", \"Straight onto the fairway\", and \"Looks like he hit the tree, Jim\" are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.",

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. \n\nFour courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.\n\nWhen playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear in the game, with one providing tactical advice for each hole.",

Among the new tricks is the \"manual\", which allows the player character to balance on two wheels. There are also more options for scoring high-trick combos. Trick combinations can also be edited and customized. It is possible to visit some of the most popular skate parks in the world, or create own areas and share them with other players. Players can also create their own skaters, with a choice of clothing and official skateboards.",

You must deal with signing and selling players, choosing your team and its formation and tactics, and making sure you have the backroom staff (coaches and scouts for example) to keep your existing players fit and ensure you discover new stars first.\n\nThis was the third release of the Championship Manager 3 game engine, and as usual it features squads updated to take account of transfers, and player statistics and abilities updated. 26 leagues from around the world are now featured.\n\nAs typical with later releases of a CM iteration, a data editor has been added. The press will now ask you loaded questions based on the team's performance and potential signings, and you must deal with these by choosing the valid answer. Also, players now interact in different ways, and do not always get on with each other, as well as having more potential reasons to be unhappy.",

Developed by a team of physicists and professional pool players, Virtual Pool brings the game to life with the highest degree of accuracy. Balls roll, skid, collide and move on a fully rendered 3D controlled pool table that mirrors reality. \r\n\r\nVirtual Pool has revolutionary features that allow players to actually 'walk' around the table to check out their next shot, take a closer look, back away, look left or right and then line-up the shot like they would in a real game with a real table. This title also allows players to take an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game! \r\n\r\nTaking game tips from World Champion pool player \"Machine Gun\" Lou Butera is guaranteed to improve the player's game. \"Machine Gun\" Lou will teach players over 30 famous trick shots the player can practice on their computer screen and then implement on a real table.

Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.\n\nThere are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.",

Two levels of swing power can be applied. \n\nIt has a complete course designer (in fact, the same one that the game developers used) that gives the user the capability to create any number of courses on their own.

      "description": "This was the fourth and final version of the Championship Manager 3 game engine. The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.\r\n\r\nYour players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.\r\n\r\nAs well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.",

      "description": "Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. \n\n<b>Game Play Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Infinite Time</b> - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. \n\n<b>High Score</b> - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?\n\n<b>Icon Challenge</b> - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.\n\n<b>Career Mode</b> - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.\n\n<b>Multiplayer Modes:</b><br>\n<b>Push</b> - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to \"push\" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.\n\n<b>Head to Head</b> - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.\n\n<b>Time Attack</b> - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.\n\n\nThe Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.\n\nThe beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.\n\nThe PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.",

      "description": "<i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</i> is the fourth game in Activision's skateboarding franchise.\n\nThe main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.\n\nAll the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.\n\nThe levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.\n\nFor multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.",

Like its predecessors, the interface still consist mainly of text, menus and clickable boxes, which are all easily navigated using a mouse. For most games this distinct lack of graphics could easily mean its downfall, but as CM4 relies heavily on realism, authenticity and an intuitive interface to attract gamers, it actually works very well.\r\n\r\nThough CM4 is visually very similar to its successors, it does offer a few new additions as well as some enhancements to the series. The most notable of these additions is the 2D pitch viewpoint, which is only available during matches. Basically, it replaces the classic commentaries with a top-down view of the match, where you can watch your players live up to your selected tactics (or watch them stuff up in style). Other additions and enhancements include a totally skinable interface, a revamped tactics engine and an enhanced contract negotiating system.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual gameplay, little as changed since the last installment. Being the manager still means you're in charge of almost every aspect of your selected club, from hiring staff to setting up team tactics and so forth. And you still have to live up to that pesky club board's expectations.",

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name).\n\n<i>Unleashed</i> takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.\n\nMultiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.",

The Jugaku corporation was one of the companies that took over the world markets, developed a technology called Hover-Ride, which let people surf through the air. Eventually, a sport was created by using this technology in races filled with violence.\n\nIn the future, nine contestants enter the <i>TrickStyle</i> competition in hopes of earning fame and money, and find more about their past along the way. They must race against each other and complete obstacle courses. Races are set in futuristic versions of cities such as London and Tokyo. Each character has its own 'special move', and in total there are 400 different tricks incorporated.",

For this, you can select one of 15 balls provided in the game. But you have also the ability to import balls, either from your harddisk, or directly from the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe 15 balls consist of: 5 different Wacky Balls, 4 different Retro Balls, Highway, Skunk Ball, and 4 Cosmic Balls (including Earth, Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury). \r\n\r\nEach ball has its own characteristics (weight, speed, and spin), so each ball plays different. Once again, you have the chance to customize your ball, changing those characteristics. But you need \u201cpower\u201d to change them. You get the \u201cpower\u201d either by decreasing characteristics (like slowing it down), or through cumulating strikes while playing.\r\n\r\nYou aren\u2019t forced to play Retro Balls in the <i>Retro Bowl</i>-lane, actually you have the full choice to play which ball in which lane. So you can even play the Earth Ball in the <i>Wacky Alley</i>, making the gameplay much crazier. \r\n\r\nOnce you start a game, all you need to do is to shift you ball to the position, you want to start from. Then left click and the ball begins rolling. Now you can control in which direction the ball is rolling through movement with your mouse. But be careful, if you move to fast, the ball ends in the gutter\u2026\r\n\r\nIn addition to the local highscore, the game also offers a worldwide highscore.",

This game is very similar to it's predecessor, but now it appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks.\n\nThe trucks in this game are licensed likenesses of trucks you may see driving down the streets of suburban America.  You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster.\n\nThe career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2.  This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game.  For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses.\n\nThe GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.",

It was the first team game on the net, and probably the first game to use both TCP and UDP. It evolved from XTrek, which was written at UCB in 1986 for use by X Windows terminals. XTrek in turn was heavily influenced by PLATO Empire. Netrek league play started in 1992. \n\nThere are a number of variants, including Bronco, Netrek Hockey, Sturgeon, Chaos, and Paradise. Bronco is the dominant form. \n\nNetrek is open source and free to play. Servers usually run on Unix systems (including Macintosh), with clients available for Windows (98 thru Vista), Macintosh (OS X 10.4, PPC or Intel), and Linux (and other Unixes). ",

It's played in a big arena that almost looks like a mini golf courses and it has both hills and curves and different obstacles. You can roll the ball into another frame and there score, making it possible to take out pins in two frames at a shot. Balls are not quite normal either, in <i>RocketBowl</i> the balls are equipped with jets and you have several different balls that you can buy when you have earned enough money. You earn money when you win tournaments or if you hit special dollar bins. The game contains 7 courses and 20 bowling balls. ",

Those who have played some of Skunk Studios other games will recognize the characters, since many of them are taken from for example Varmintz. The controls for the game are quite simple to learn since the mouse is used entirely.\r\n\r\nIn the game there are two modes of play. The first is the classic old school tennis where you play in best of three sets. The other one is Ring mode where each match takes two minutes. Here you have to score more points than your opponent by collecting rings. The rings comes in different colours and sizes that give a different amount of points. The ring mode also contain various power ups like a turtle that slows the ball down or the bomb that clears all the rings currently available. After beating an opponent you will unlock it and can use it later on. This is for both game modes. ",

      "description": "As coach, you pick from either the 30 fictitious Backyard Kits, 31 real major league players portrayed as kids, or both. Pick a Backyard Sports team or create your own, or pick from 30 licensed MLB teams (with uniforms and logos). Play a single game, or an entire season (winning pennants and trophies and maybe getting into the Hall of Fame), or even online against other BB2001 players. There's even batting practice, from Tee-ball to Hard difficulties, and a Spectator mode to let two teams duke it out while you watch. And, as with Backyard Sports titles, there are power-ups: pitches like the Big Freeze, Corkscrew, or Elevator.\r\n\r\nThe game features pretty simple menus, baseball cards of all the players, rosters and schedules, a system of \"Good & Bad Days\" that alter players' stats (one person may not like Tuesdays, or be much better when a particular person is on the other team, etc). Players do move differently on different fields, slower on sand and faster on turf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The player accesses all aspects of the game from team selection, transfers, media interaction tactics and the like via a menu system. Actual games are viewed in a top down 2-D mode. As is customary with games in this series a data editor is supplied so that the player can update the game as transfers take place and regulations change. Some of the game's featured statistics are:<ul>\n<li>over one hundred attributes for each player,</li>\n<li>over five thousand teams in fifty countries,</li>\n<li>over one hundred attributes for each player</li>\n<li>statistics for over a quarter of a million players and staff,</li>\n<li>a database with over two and a half thousand contributors.</li></ul>New game elements include:<ul>\n<li>A Media section which allows managers to influence the managers of other teams and players by making statements to the press and TV</li>\n<li>A completely revised interface</li>\n<li>The Physio Room which provides accurate injury data</li></ul>",

You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball, \"stretch\" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball. \n\nYou are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. \n\nThe game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive. ",

      "description": "<i>Worldwide Soccer Manager 2007</i> is the third entry in the soccer management series. Numerous new features have been introduced in this installment. These include a new default GUI created with the aid of user feedback in an attempt to make it more user friendly. \n\nThe game also includes pre-match team talks. In the previous edition, only half-time and full-time team talks could be given. The game has also increased functionality of the half-time team talk, managers can now target individual opposition players for special attention, such as instructing players to close them down or always to tackle them with force. \n\nA significant new addition is the ability to create a feeder club affiliation. This allows larger clubs to set up a relationships with a smaller club and vice versa. This can be used by users managing larger clubs to loan out players to their feeder club to gain the first team experience that they are unable to get at higher levels. On the other hand, the smaller clubs can benefit from the ability of these players. \n",

      "description": "<i>Deer Avenger 2</i> is an obscene parody of the many deer hunter games seen in the PC market.  Only this time...you're the deer.\n\nOne late afternoon, our hero spies a hot-date doe, and he's hoping to get some tail.  But before he can make a move three redneck hunters pop out of nowhere, and mow her down with their truck.  Angry with revenge, the testosterone-laden deer picks up his high-powered tranquilizer gun and follows the tracks back to the city...\n\nUsing your tranquilizer gun, it is up to you to hunt three targets across three different levels.  In order to find your targets, you will have to travel to the local suburbs, an office building, and a shady bar.  But before the hunters will reveal themselves, you have to take down the locals first.  Bikers, neighbors, office workers, and local beer-chugging idiots will stop your every attempt at urban domination.  Deer Avenger 2 features side-scrolling looping levels, where you pivot around one point and aim 360 degrees around you.  Aim your gun with the mouse, and hold shift to take cover.  In case you get into a tight situation, you can also fart to take out enemies around you.  Make sure to shoot pieces of the scenery as well.  You never know if something will contain life-giving salt lick.\n\nDeer Avenger 2 is a parody and has a silly undertone to it.  All levels and cut scenes are completely 2D and animated, making it feel like a cartoon.  The game pokes fun at \"rednecks\", who are often the butt of many grotesque jokes the game throws out.  The content and dialog provided also acts as a commentary to the mocking undertone in the game.\n",

Apparently, the codes were obtainable from GapKids stores at different intervals during the time that the promotion was active.\n\nOne of the unlocked games is Snowed In, a Pac-Man clone where your GapKid must clear all the snow in a maze while dodging killer snowmen. The mazes have snowblower powerups that can take out the snowmen and also accelerate the plowing job. The next unlocked game is Snowman Match where you must match 8 snowmen within a time limit. The game show you a snowman dressed in Gap clothing which quickly melts away to be replaced for 4 more snowmen. Match the right snowman (and sometimes, there are some very similar snowmen). The final unlocked game is Snowboard Slalom, a downhill snowboarding race where you need to dodge logs, trees, rocks, and ice patches on the way down in an effort to make it to the bottom before the time cutoff.\n\nThe first locked game is Skate Race. It is a variation of the Nibbles concept. The last locked game is Snowball Frenzy where you need to take out all the kids in the neighborhood by striking with an unlimited supply of snowballs.",

      "description": "<i>Deer Avenger</i> is a parody hunting game where a well-armed deer named Bambo assumes the role of protagonist. The deer is out to take down as many humans as he can find who are wandering through his wilderness. The player selects from 3 weapons (an M-16, a bazooka, or a sling-shot) and then selects from among 3 locales (green West Virginia or Connecticut, or snowy Minnesota). The gameplay consists of roving on an overhead forest map and searching for signs of recent hunter activity (such as beer cans, nudie mags, tree carvings, or a name written in the snow with urine). Then the player can hunt from that point which involves scrolling through a 360-degree panorama of the area, waiting for humans to show up. Bambo can also try to encourage humans to show up with assorted calls.\n\nThe emphasis of the game is the comedy aspect. Bambo has a variety of quips and calls that he rotates through during the game depending on the situation. Further, there are other touches such as when you use your binoculars to get a closer look at the region.\n",

There are 18 holes per course, just like in real life, which totals to 54 holes. The game features a two-player versus mode and three single player modes. You can choose from one of six different characters, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Like many other golf games, you use an accurate click type of play, where you click in an overhead map where you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, and power. In Versus mode, you can earn \"super-clubs\" that can only be used once. These can also be traded between friends. \n\nThe ACA NeoGeo series release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One contain both the US and Japanese game versions, as well as Hi Score and Caravan modes which can all be launched from the main menu.",

      "description": "The members of the Clue Finders team -- including Owen, Leslie, Santiago, and Joni, along with their timid yet trusty talking laptop computer, LapTrap -- receive a distress signal from a remote mansion that was apparently sent by Joni's uncle. The gang cautiously investigates the signal only to learn that the mansion is an elaborate sequence of traps devised by a collaboration of their nemeses from previous games in the Clue Finders franchise. \n\nThere are four unique traps, each designed by one of the four villains, one designed for each of the four children. The traps/games are:\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Owen's Radical Pizza Race:</strong> the villain Fletcher Limburger designed a skateboard course to challenge Owen. The course consists of giant pizzas and the skateboard is a giant sub sandwich with wheels. Dodge or jump the pizza ingredients in your path, except for the anchovies, which can be picked up and used offensively in a later level.\n\n<li><strong>Leslie's Bookerang Library:</strong> Alistair Loveless concocted a special library for Leslie. Little demons drop large books into the room. In the back of the library is a theme, such as 'geometry', 'geography', or 'capital cities'. The dropped books each have a title and Leslie must jump on the books that have titles pertaining to the specified topic. Doing so results in that dropped book becoming permanent. Jumping on another book will crush the book. The goal is to stack enough books to escape. There are also special books that Leslie can pick up and store as weapons in a later stage.\n\n<li><strong>Santiago's Pinball Predicament:</strong> Pericles Lear, who is big on toys, creates several life size pinball tables in which Santiago is the pinball. The pinball is actually a small rocketship that Santiago can rotate and thrust. This is still tricky because of all the other things on a pinball table that can bump the ball. The goal is to light up all of the letters on the board (doing so entails solving some mini-puzzles) and then entering the hole that is Lear's mouth. There are also batteries that Santiago can collect to be used as weapons in a later stage.\n\n<li><strong>Joni's Last-Chance Labyrinth:</strong> Ms. Rose creates this deadly plant-filled cavern to doom Joni. However, when each of her friends escape their traps, they join Joni on her quest. Up to four of them journey through this side-scrolling platform adventure. Any of the characters that have joined Joni can take the lead. Whichever character takes the lead can use whichever weapon that have acquired: anchovies, books, batteries, or oranges (which are what Joni accumulates in this trap). Each weapon has unique advantages.\n</ol>",

      "description": "The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).\n\nThe Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.\n\nThe game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nThe multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.",

Players will help Charlie recruit his Peanuts friends onto the team (Snoopy, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Pigpen and more) in Story Mode by solving puzzles which teach social skills. The gang will train using 10 character-specific mini-games. For instance, Lucy teaches fielding, Shroeder teaches pitching etc.\n\nThe game approaches baseball from a beginner's perspective so kids can learn everything about the game of baseball - from hitting the ball, catching and fielding to scoring runs. When the team is complete, and all of the mini-games have been finished, the team will play a full game of baseball. During the \"Big Game\" players can choose 6 or 9 innings to test their skill.\n\nThe game is played in point-and-click manner and features music and sound effects plus the graphics of the lovable Peanuts characters in their native cartoon atmosphere.",

Playing on a pool table layout without pockets, your goal is to make balls of the same color collide with each other. When they do, they turn grey, and are removed from the board when they have stopped moving. There is at least one white cue-ball - these do not need to be removed, but the first shot must be made using it. Multiple shots can be in progress simultaneously - the only requirements are that the starting ball is not moving, and is not greyed.\n\nA total of 84 stages are available, all with different layouts, and various fixtures that affect your balls. There are pinball-style bouncers which cause ricochets, dots which must be removed by running a ball over them, colour-changing vats, and fans and magnets to affect ball motion.",

Training points can be assigned to save practice, weights, team talks, running and friendly matches \u2013 each has a different effect on your overall conditions.\n\nMatches are played out on a screen displaying names and ratings for both teams. If the Arcade mode is on, you will be required to make saves, by moving the mouse to stop the ball as it travels towards the goal. In Strategy mode, you have three options as to how to attempt the save. The Instant Save option determines whether the save is successful, based on your goalkeeper's quality.\n\nYour prestige will increase more for making difficult saves, and drop more from conceding soft goals. This can be used to improve your contract and reputation. Media reporters will sometimes ask questions about the recent performances of yourself and the team, with multiple-choice answers affecting the views of your manager and supporters.",

      "description": "Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.\n\nExhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.\n\nVersion differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.\n\nEach character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. \n\nMinigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.",

      "description": "<i>NFL Pro League Football</i> is a football simulation which allows the player to manage a football team. In the league play game variation, the player will need to create a game plan (or optionally allow the computer to create one). A wide variety of statistics can be set for the teams, including the percentage of times the team should run the ball in various scenarios, pass defense strategies, pass coverage, select players for carrying the ball, play types, and many other options (each team has over 100 stats that can be set). The player can also set various weather conditions, and even call the coin toss. Based on all of the parameters that have been selected, the computer will simulate a game. Optionally, the player can view the game play by play with an overhead view where the computer uses X's and O's to represent the players on the field and provides a commentary. After the game, a stats keeper is available which allows the player to analyze the game to find weaknesses and strengths that can be tuned to improved the team for the next game. Various records and season stats are kept here as well. The player also has the ability to scout for new players and update teams.\n\nAlso included is the NFL Headup Football game variation. In this game two players compete (or one player competes against the computer) in a single game. Each player acts as the coach and needs to call the game play by play. After each play is selected, the computer will simulate the outcome.\n\nTwo-player games can be played on the same computer or via modem. The game allows the player to print out game plans as well as all of the available statistics.\n\n<i>NFL Pro League Football</i> is an officially licensed game, and features 3 years of data on real players and teams.

      "description": "<i>Shaun White Snowboarding</i> gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.\n\nDuring the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.\n\nThe game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.",

There are two difficulties of play: <i>Beginner</i>, which automatically fields the ball for the player while <i>Exciting</i> has the player do the field manually.  Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.\n\nThe standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.",

      "description": "<i>Alley 19 Bowling</i> is a happy-go-lucky bowling simulation which features an atmosphere of 1950s America. The theme, music, sound effects and graphics take you back to the time when jukeboxes played your favorite rock and roll tunes and the jitterbug was the hottest dance craze.\n\nThe game starts in the Pro Shop, where you enter the names of yourself and the 3 other bowlers playing against you. Choose whether they are human or computer players, right- or left-handed, and which ball they'll use. You set your preferences here too - the music and sound volumes, whether to turn the \"ball guide\" on or off, and whether to use the normal or \"Rock-n-Bowl\" background. When done, click \"Bowl\" to begin playing.\n\nLike in real bowling, the object is to knock down all 10 pins in as few turns as possible. All action is handled with your mouse and takes some practice to master.\n\nTo begin, move the mouse to the right until you pick up your ball. Then move left until you are positioned in the lane. Left-click and hold the mouse button down and move left or right to position the shot. Then move it forward and let go when you want to release the ball. The faster your forward stroke, the quicker the ball will roll. (If you have the \"ball guide\" option \"on\", you'll visually see an illustration of ball's path before you throw it.) You are able to hook your shot by moving the mouse just before letting go.\n\nThe game keeps track of the number of games you have bowled, your high score, average score, and highest three-game series.\n\nAlthough advertised, multiplayer support over a LAN or the Internet was only playable in the Macintosh version when the game first shipped. A patch must be obtained (v1.7) to enable multiplayer in Windows.",
