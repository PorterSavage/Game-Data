Choose from three classes of bike (125, 250 and 500cc), and between 8 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, France,England and Sweden) and 15 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, Western Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Holland, Belgium, France, England, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Brazil) original tracks depending on the version, at five difficulty levels (with the lower ones offering automatic gear changes). \n\nThe player can enter single races (always including qualifying) or complete in a full season. The action is viewed from the handlebars of your bike, a novelty for motorcycle racing at the time. The game engine is similar to that used by Grand Prix Circuit, but now incorporates hills.",

      "description": "<i>Death Rally</i> is a top-down racing game where the player can rely on more than speed to be the number one, and brains must be riding along brawn to get the most from each race. \n\nStarting with only $495 and a lowly car, the player must compete in one of three races (picked from 19 tracks) with increasingly difficult opponents but higher rewards, getting enough money to buy new cars, choosing from six models, and enhance them with one to four upgrades for engine (increase top speed), tires (improve traction, allowing to drift less on turns) and armor (reduces the damage caused by opponents, mines or collisions). But there are more ways to spend money by reaching the underground market where the player can buy land mines (can be dropped to get opponents directly behind or create traps in narrow sections), get some rocket fuel (which increases boost speed greatly at the expense of some damage for both the user car and the ones directly behind) or bribe a mechanic to mess around with the best-ranked opponent car. All these upgrades are valid for one race only.\n\nThe race varies in length depending on the difficulty chosen, but follow the same structure: four drivers with the starting grid set according to the championship table, with the worst placed starting in front and so on, and the first to cross the line after the stipulated number of laps wins or the last driver standing wins. At the same time, the fourth place driver gets no points and no money, including pick up bonuses, and lapped drivers get the same luck.  The player can use a booster to increase speed for a few seconds, but once the reserve is depleted, the player has to wait it replenishes or pick up icons scattered on the track. Similar items appear to replenish ammo, repair the car or give small money bonuses. Occasionally, large money and repair items appear, which provide a much larger bonus. \n\nAlong the money earned in races, there are several bonuses if the player manages to wipe out all competition, complete the race without a scratch or completing a streak of wins, or accepting certain missions for some sponsors, such as collecting steroids and win the race or destroy an opponent. The value of these bonus changes according to the car: a bonus with the Vagabond can be worth as little as $650, but with the Deliverator a mission can be worth 12 grand, regardless of the race selected.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to top the championship table, and then defeat   the Adversary in a special track.",

      "description": "<i>Carmageddon</i> is a violent car racing game where the racing element can be equally important as wrecking opponents' cars or gathering kills by ramming into pedestrians. At the beginning the player has only one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to one's vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians.\n\nDamage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If a specific opponent's car is wrecked multiple times in successive races, it is added to the choice of available vehicles. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses that range from useful (more speed, instant brake) to fun and downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing by finishing first, wrecking everything in sight is encouraged. The game offers open environments where exploration away from the racing course is encouraged.",

There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.",

The cars on offer range from police car and VW Beetle to school bus and truck, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses - trying to win with the bus, which involves blocking everyone behind the hideously slow vehicle for 3 laps, is perhaps the ultimate challenge.\n\nInitially there are 5 tracks available, with practice and single race modes as well as full championship at 3 levels - winning each of the first 2 levels unlocks an extra track. They all have hazards running through them, and sections where you must make a split-second choice between the safer route and the risky but potentially rewarding one. Multiplayer can be done via network or by split-screen - in a break with convention the screen is split vertically rather than horizontally.",

The protagonist is a freelance Raider who ventures into the dangerous Free Zone, where rare and expensive items can be scavenged. Getting those items, however, won't be easy: other raiders are headed towards the Zone with the same intention, and the hero must race them, using all means to get there first. The futuristic cars resemble those that were used in the 20th century, with an important difference: they are equipped with hover plates and heavy weaponry. The protagonist should search for new weapons, shield regenerators and jet packs, as he races and sabotages opponent cars.\n\nThe game features sixteen different tracks, five selectable hovercars (one of them hidden), and eight usable weapons. Multiplayer can be accessed through IPX Network, two-player modem, or serial support, and can accommodate up to eight players.",

      "description": "<i>Autoduel</i> is a hybrid game based on Steve Jackson Games board game <i>Car Wars</i>. It incorporates elements of role-playing, driving and action-based combat. The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.\n\nThe game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.",

The framework is a futuristic race inspired by <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0072856\">Deathrace 2000</a> and <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0071282\">The Cars That Ate Paris</a>: The contestants, in sport cars, monster trucks, and other motorized abominations, are placed on a track, a real populated area.

Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.\n\nYou can choose whether to drive a single race at Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy, Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track.

      "description": "In Papyrus' third racing game, the focus is moved from open-wheeled cars (IndyCar Racing) to closed-cockpit Nascar stock cars. 640x480 is the highest resolution on offer, on the CD-ROM version.\n\nNascar Racing is a detailed simulation with realistic car models, accurate controls and room for a distinct racing style. Nine tracks are featured, the Watkins Glen road course alongside oval racing. You have full control over the car's set up and paint job.\n\nTo reach a wide audience, various driving aids are available, such as auto-shifting and auto-braking. Races can be fine-tuned with the amount of laps.\n\nOne of the notable features is drafting, by which you can position your car just inches off the rear of competitors in front of you. When in this aerodynamically optimal position, you gain acceleration, conserve fuel and place less stress on the mechanical parts. By timing right, you can also make a quick pass.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>WipEout XL</i> is set in the year 2097, around four decades after its predecessor. Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.\n\nEach vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.",

Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  \n\nThis is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike.

You can call up information about your car (fuel, tires, wings, wheel stagger) during the races at any time. Aside from the in-game paint shop, there was an active modding community at work with many custom car sets available online.",

The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.\n\nIn addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode.  The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.",

      "description": "After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime.  During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime.  Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude.  Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process.  Now it is time for revenge.  Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others.  Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way.  It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i> is similar in its concept to its predecessors: the player is cast in the role of a vicious (albeit novice) criminal, who performs tasks for crime lords and gradually raises his rank in the criminal world. Driving is the main gameplay element in the game, though the player can also fully explore the city on foot. For the first time in the series, the entire game is rendered in 3D. Different camera angles are available for driving, and free camera rotation is available when on foot. \n\nAs opposed to the previous games, Liberty City is the only city the player can explore in the game. The game puts more emphasis on the story, displaying cutscenes before each mission. In order to complete the game it is necessary to perform all the main story missions; however, the player often has the choice between several missions at a given moment. The missions include chases, races, short third-person shooter sequences, as well as various mini-game-like activities. Outside of the missions, the player is free to explore the city and undertake sub-missions, for example working as a taxi driver, delivering sick people to the hospital in an ambulance car, etc. ",

      "description": "Tommy Vercetti is a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends.  Because he didn't rat out his \"family\", Tommy's sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything.  Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it's up to Tommy to clear a path.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> offers the same free-roaming driving and action gameplay style as its predecessor, but in a new setting based on the city of Miami. The game includes all the features of the previous installment and builds upon them. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of typical vehicles from the 1980's. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from <i>GTA III</i>. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat.\n\nNew to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFirearms are for the most part the same as in <i>GTA III</i>, and melee weapons have been added to the protagonist's arsenal. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Activities outside of the missions (driving taxis, delivering sick people to hospitals, firefighting and playing a vigilante policeman) are available as well.\n\nTo effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured in the previous game) across ten radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as <i>I Ran</i> by Flock of Seagulls, <i>The Message</i> by Grandmaster Flash, <i>You've Got Another Thing Coming</i> by Judas Priest, and <i>Out of Touch</i> by Hall & Oates.",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

      "description": "Nick Kang is a young Chinese-American detective who has been suspended from the Los Angeles Police Department due to his extreme methods of policing and his ability to cause massive amounts of damage to property. However, Wanda Parks, the Chief of the E.O.D (Elite Operations Division), requires Nick's  assistance in a case that involves attacks on various venues in the Chinatown district. At first Nick is reluctant to help, preferring the vigilante life and focusing on avenging his father's death. However, he eventually agrees to conduct the investigation, on one condition: he must do it his way.\n\n<i>True Crime: Streets of LA</i> is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.\n\nNick can hijack any car on the street (usually with little to no repercussions) and freely drive through the 240 square miles of Los Angeles. Nick is capable of firing his weapon when driving; in an open top vehicle, it is possible to aim anywhere. The player can also opt for exploring the city on foot. Nick will be frequently contacted by other police officers and informed about various street crimes. He can then fight perpetrators, arrest them, knock them unconscious, or kill them to deal with these crimes.\n\nThe gameplay during the missions is separated into third-person shooting, fighting, and (more rarely) stealth sequences. All of these usually take place in relatively small, restricted environments. The shooting sequences involve Nick dealing with waves of enemies that appear in different places. Nick must react quickly, moving, crouching, or diving (with a \"bullet time\" effect) to avoid enemy attacks. A limited amount of painkillers can be found in such stages.\n\nDuring the fighting sequences, Nick utilizes his martial arts techniques to defeat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. Nick can punch, kick, grapple and throw enemies. The player can execute combos by pressing various combinations of buttons consecutively. It is also possible to pick up primitive melee weapons lying around, or take them from enemies. Both shooting and fighting stages have destructible environments.\n\nStealth missions typically involve Nick traversing a hostile area without attracting the enemies' attention; the mission is failed if an enemy hasn't been dealt with silently, or shortly after he has discovered Nick. The player has the option of killing enemies or knocking them down; the latter awards the protagonist \"good cop\" points. Conversely, \"bad cop\" points are given to Nick for killing innocents or surrendered criminals. Depending on Nick's rating in these categories, the storyline branches during later chapters, leading to different endings.",

They must race against each other and complete obstacle courses. Races are set in futuristic versions of cities such as London and Tokyo.

There are dozens of these, all with different handling characteristics, and include trucks, buses and even boats.\r\n\r\nThe mission structures are non-linear, meaning that how you perform in one part can affect how later parts unfold, and the game includes Perspective Corrected 3D graphics with realistic shadows and rotational effect, as well as a full 3D soundtrack of aggressive rap and mid-tempo rock.",

You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster.\n\nThe career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2.  This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game.  For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses.\n\nThe GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.",

Choose from 32 models, legendary classics as well as futuristic supercars, like the Ford GT (classified under these categories in the game: Living Legends, Movie Stars, SVT, Concept, Off Road, Custom and Stock Car).\r\n\r\nThe 16 graphically detailed venues include road race tracks, off-road (over desert and jungle terrain), high speed oval speedways and race circuits. There are different competition types to test your driving skills including: Time Attack, Elimination, Racing Line, Driving Skills and more.\r\n\r\nYou select the amount of driving control you want. Standard gives you automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes and traction control. Choose Advanced for more precision driving with a manual transmission and more option selections. Learn the controls of the game in \"Quick Race\" which automatically selects a car for you and puts you on a pre-selected track. Then choose the \"Single Player\" to race with computer opponents or \"Multi Player\" for head-to-head competition with a friend. Select from different background music types (rock, funk etc.) to further customize your experience.\r\n\r\nViews can be toggled between 1st and 3rd person perspective. On screen in the first person view, the speedometer, tachometer, rear view mirror, are shown as well as a map on left side showing your current location and nearby competitors. Classic car dash panels differ from more modern cars, too. Depending upon your perspective, you'll see your lap times, overall position, rpms and speed.",

      "description": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways.\n\n<i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> is the fifth game in the <i>GTA</i> series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world.\n\nThe missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs.\n\nAs in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. <i>San Andreas</i> adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc.",

But contrary to its predecessor, <i>FlatOut 2</i> is now a complete arcade-racing game.\n\nThe core of the game is the career mode which features 3 different racing-classes: Derby, Race and Street. Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine.\n\nInside the classes you find different kinds of events: from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.\n\nIf you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more. These mini-games can also be played with up to 8 players on one PC in a hot-seat mode.",

      "description": "TOCA Race Driver 3 follows on from the ideas started in Race Driver 2. The game attempts to include as many different forms of four-wheeled racing in one game, as well as injecting each with a high degree of realism.\n\nThe game has over 70 licensed cars and 80 real tracks, as well as 35 different disciplines of racing.\n\nThere are two main gameplay modes. The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D rendered cutscenes shown from the player's point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer's life aside from just the racing. This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines.\n\nThe second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has no back-story and longer, more realistic races.\n\nTOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an easier experience. This mode is also noticeably easier than the Simulation mode from TOCA Race Driver 2.",

      "description": "The 2006 game in the <i>Need for Speed</i> series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.\n\nEnhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in <i>NFS:U</i> and replaced by drag races in <i>NFS:MW</i>) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.\n\nThe city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.\n\nThe crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.",

      "description": "Billed as an \"edutainment\" game for children, this title is all about how to build a car from the ground up using parts & pieces found on Gary's lawn. When a road-worthy auto is finished, drive your creation around the neighborhood where different \"missions\" can be played through (rescuing a cat from a tree, finding Freddy's dog, for example). Enter it in the Auto Show for prizes and praise.\n\nSort through Gary's huge mound of junk, pick out the \"thing-a-ma-bobs\" and \"whatchamacallits\" you want, and then figure out which of them fit together. You'll need to put your thinking cap on to build a working vehicle - a roadster, truck, sedan or race car. Along the way, Gary will give minor advice but doesn't give it all away. Using your logic and creativity skills, learn what makes a car tick - and which parts are the best for what your auto should do. (Climbing a steep hill or racing on a race track requires more powerful stuff than Mom's old jalopy!)  When you've finished your first vehicle, you can download additional parts from the official website to beef it up and download a bonus game.\n\nThe game includes interactive animations and videos, an easy point-and-click interface and multiple choice options, all of which add to the replay value.",

Winning nine races lets you finish up with the main race against Chick Hicks. Activities include:<ul>\n<li>Hip-Hop it Up: follow along with Ramone's dance moves if you can.</li><br>\n<li>Luigi's Fantastico Fun: Guido has to catch falling tires, and <i>only</i> tires before Luigi's customers arrive.</li><br>\n<li>Radiator Springs Curios: a memory game, replacing items in the Curio shop.</li><br>\n<li>Fill 'Er Up: follow the patterns on the gas pumps to provide full service for each of Flo's customers.</li><br>\n<li>Drive-in and Out: a tile sliding game, shifting cars around in the Drive-In parking lot so you can reach the exit.</li><br>\n<li>Speed Trap: arcade game, avoiding rocks and oil slicks as you chase speeders down the highway.</li><br>\n<li>Tow the Line: be Mater, picking up cars in the tow yard, without bumping into things...</li><br>\n<li>Tractor Round-Up: tractor-tipping! Don't bump into the tractors or the fence.</li><br>\n<li>Doc's Tune-Up: guide nuts and other obstructing items out of tailpipes without touching the sides.</li><br>\n<li>Sarge's Boot Camp: run Sarge's obstacle course.</li></ul>All the activities use mouse controls, clicking on on-screen directional arrows or holding a mouse-button down. The suggested age group for this game is 4+ - young players may need help understanding the instructions for some of the games, though the games themselves are fairly simple.",

Players can visit the different departments to prepare the vehicles (cleaning, equipping, test rides) and earn certificates of achievements. The level progress and medals are stored in a central dispatch center. It also contains a number of images children can print and color.\n\nThe town map acts as a central hub where the different locations are shown. When a department lights up, the player can visit it to start a mission. There are twelve missions in total and the player will control over thirteen different vehicles. The missions have the player help with traffic jams, floods, forest fires and ships in distress. They are usually presented as a mini-game where the player steers the vehicle using simple and forgiving mouse control.",

      "description": "<em>Bus Driver</em> is a driving game with a difference. It doesn't rely on speed or encourage the player to smash things up. There's no racing or rallying aspect. In fact, it's exactly what its title suggests: A <i>bus</i> driving game.\n\nHere, the focus is on driving safely, obeying the laws of the road, and getting passengers to their destinations. There are 12 different buses and 30 different routes (or 'missions'). They all take place within the same city but at different times of the day and in varying weather conditions. The player could be taking tired factory workers home as the sun is setting, ferrying holiday-makers to the ski-resort in brilliant sunshine, or escorting children to school in the early morning.\n\nPoints are awarded for correct signalling, stopping at red-lights and keeping to the scheduled timetable. Points are deducted for wanton destruction, driving on the wrong side of the road, braking too hard and various other infractions. But the game doesn't place many <i>real</i> restrictions on the player: they won't get heavily penalised if they're late to the stops. There is no timer that signals the end of the game. There's nothing to stop the player deviating from their route and going on a little sightseeing trip of their own.\n\n<em>Bus Driver</em> offers a rather unique, sedate alternative to the usual vehicular gaming experience.",

      "description": "The heart of <i>GRID</i> is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.\n\nBut of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.\n\nTo earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like \"Finish before Team Top Secret\" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.\n\nBesides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.",

Are you a bad enough dolphin to rescue the Prime Minister?\" That's right, after the kidnapping of the Prime Minister the only thing that can rescue him it turns out is a dolphin armed with lasers. <i>Laser Dolphin</i> is a platform game where you must collect golden fishes, weapons, and destroy enemies standing in your path to advance through the levels and ultimately save the Prime Minister.\n\nControlling the dolphin is done via keyboard and mouse and you can jump out of the water with the use of a little speed and of course aiming up otherwise most of your time is spent swimming. Aptly named <i>Laser Dolphin</i> has a laser strapped to his back that would make Dr.Evil proud. His laser is either a single blast of can be charged up for and even more powerful blast by holding down fire. Other weapons such as guided missiles and laser swords can also be strapped to his back. The laser sword has the unique ability to bounce back enemy fire. The enemies in this game adventure range from Earthbound crazed creatures like suicidal turtles with TNT strapped to their shells, and seagulls that drop bombs from the air. As you advance through the levels you will confront robotic enemies that the aliens have deployed such as, robotic sharks, evil dolphins, and robotic sentries and mines.\n\n\nYour adventure will span fifty levels that take place on four different worlds from the Earth to the alien home world. A volcanic planet and an ice-bound one will also need to be traversed. After rescuing the Prime Minister you can then try out the stunt mode of the game where you must do jumping, flipping and other stunts to gain points and open other stunt levels. There's also a race mode where you must swim as quickly as you can through hoops in the water. The higher the points you score the more levels you will open up. Earning high-points will also unlock cheat modes that range from invincibility to giant dolphins and gravity adjusters. And if after all that you still need more to do, there's a built in construction set where you can make your own levels.",

Different camera perspectives are combined with the option to fly. When riding up a hill at a high speed, the buggy can extend its flaps to fly. This can be combined with shooting from a first person perspective, either using the mouse of the keyboard to combine these actions.\n\nThe game mechanics are introduced on a tutorial map and players can then join servers set up by others, or create a new server and optionally add AI-controlled bots. Players can chat while playing using text and the graphics scale back and forth automatically based on the available bandwidth, though it also possible to lock them at a certain setting.",

Players control a space ship on many tracks filled obstacles, pipes, floating platforms and other hazards. Gameplay is arcade-like, requiring perfect jumps, evasive actions and precise timing. To complete courses, players only need to reach the end without crashing. There is an unlimited amount of tries.\n\nThe courses have different themes that consist of three tracks each. Later levels include special tiles that speed up or slow down the ship, bounce it around, reverse it, or turn gravity upside down. Special strategies are also introduced, such as grinding off ledges, consecutive jumps and small changes in direction. After completing a number of tracks, bonus options become available, allowing the player to change the ship's colour, shoot obstacles, and more. All tracks are available right away and the game keeps track of the fastest times. It also includes an editor to create, share and import custom levels.",

The game's sleeve includes a pair of red-tinted paper glasses to help decode these clues.\n\nActivities in the game include skateboarding, rollerblading, and bicycling around various obstacle courses; negotiating a complex ladder maze in order to ascend to the tree house; a music mix station in the tree house; and video game system in the tree house that has 2 arcade-style games: a lunar lander-style game and a Pong</a> game whose game field is obscured with the same red blocks used to hide clues throughout the game.\n",

      "description": "As it's predecessor, the racing-game <i>DiRT 2</i> doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:\n<ul><li><b>Rallye</b> - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.</li>\n<li><b>Trailblazer</b> - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.</li>\n<li><b>Raid</b> - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.</li>\n<li><b>Landrush</b> - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.</li>\n<li><b>Rallyecross</b> - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.</li> \n<li><b>Gatecrasher</b> - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.</li>\n<li><b>Domination</b> - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.</li>\n<li><b>Last Man Standing</b> - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.</li></ul>\nEach event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.\n\nThe game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.",

      "description": "<i>RunMan: Race Around the World</i> is the sixth game in the long-running <i>RunMan</i> series with the titular character doing what he does best: running as fast as possible. There is a race organized to determine who is the fastest in the world, but when RunMan arrives all the other participants flee. He is declared the winner, but RunMan does not want an unearned crown and decides to run all alone anyway.\n\nThe game is divided in different zones (the overview is modelled after the one from the Super Mario World games) with seven levels each. The goal is simply to reach the destination to unlock the next level. Replaying is encouraged by three medals that can be earned per level, from bronze to gold, based on the completion time. Additionally the game awards points for actions and deducts some when RunMan is slowed down or dies.\n\nNext to regular running, RunMan can speed up (called zooming) with an additional key. While in this mode he can also take out most enemies, break through certain blocks and jump into walls to kick off them and reach higher areas. Players often need to switch quickly between both modes as there are also obstacles and enemies that require the regular running mode to pass, for instance sleeping enemies or fireblocks. Gameplay is designed to move as swiftly as possible, with swings, boosting pads and ramps. When RunMan dies or disappears into a gap he reappears right away as the completion time is the only thing that matters. He can also dive down in the air or fly using a hang glider.\n\nThe last level of each zone is a boss level. It usually requires RunMan not to make a single mistake as he is chased by a monster, similar to RunMan's Monster Fracas. When the monster catches up, the level needs to be replayed immediately. The game saves ghosts of sessions automatically and these can also be loaded in-game to beat the best time or to exchange them with friends.\n\nThe game retains the typical drawn cartoon style, accompanied by '40s jazz and blues music.",

      "description": "<em>Super Laser Racer</em> is a top-down racing game with gameplay elements inspired by games such as Mario Kart and F-Zero and a graphical style reminiscent of games with vector graphics such as Asteroids.\n\nThe game features 12 different tracks. The tracks can be played separately in Quick Race mode or in a determined order through the 4 offered tournaments. At the beginning, only one tournament is available. Each other tournament is unlocked by winning the previous tournament. Some tracks have a complex design, such as several branches or a crisscross area, which will influence the strategy used to negotiate them depending on the race situation.\n\nThe player can choose between 12 ships. Each ship has a different strength in each of the following categories: Acceleration, Speed, Steering and Shield. Initially, only 3 ships are available. The others are unlocked through victory in the tournaments.\n\nA race opposes 12 competitors, racing and fighting during 5 laps (by default, it can be changed in the options). Each track has:\n<ul>\n<li>Turbo boost pads. These will increase the speed of the ship flying over it.</li>\n<li>Weapon pick-up pads. Flying over a weapon pad will give the player a random weapon. Among the weapons are front weapons, such as lasers and plasmas and rear weapons, such as mines and bombs.</li>\n<li>A recharge \"pit\" area, similar to the one found in <i>F-Zero</i>. Flying over it will heal the ship, removing some damage from the damage bar of the ship. The damage bar will increase when the ships goes out of the track, collide with the track boundaries or is hit by an enemy weapon.</li>\n</ul>\nBesides the normal race mode, two additional modes are available. Eliminator mode removes the damage constraint but each turn the competitor in last position will be removed of the race. In Survivor mode, the recharge area is removed and the winner is the last one not to have its damage bar filled.",

      "description": "The easiest way to describe <i>Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing</i> would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.\n\nThe core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.\n\nThe game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more. \n\nMultiplayer consists of a split screen mode for up to four players and an online mode (not available in the PC-version). Besides normal races several battle modes are waiting like King of the Hill or simple Deathmatch. Completing a mission or winning a race either in single player or in multiplayer earns the player SEGA miles which are used in the internal shop to unlock additional characters and tracks.\n\nThe Xbox 360-release features in addition to the SEGA characters and tracks also Rare\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie - hence the additional subtitle.",

While the game is completely in 3D the player cannot steer and so effectively the game takes place on a 2D plane similar to Trials 2 from the same developer. Just like the aforementioned motor racing game the player can shift the weight of the monster truck in mid air to ensure the vehicle lands on all fours again.\n\nEach level has to be finished within a certain time frame. Depending on the time the player sets to get to the finish he or she earns a bronze, silver or gold medal. Obstacles that need to be overcome range from jumps over buses, loopings, gaps, falling rocks, etc.\n\nIn the levels the player can collect nitro which can be used to gain a speed boost to bridge larger gaps.\n\n",

In smartphones, the car can be controlled either using the touch screen alone or using the accelerometer (the Zeebo version is controlled using the regular controller). The car also has a boost feature, which can be recharged by collecting blue lightning bolt power-ups during the races. Another way of gaining some speed is through the opponents' windshadow. The player can win not only by being the fastest racer, but also by taking his/her opponents out of the race by hitting them. Other power-ups include car armor (which makes the car less vulnerable to hits), money (to buy new cars and upgrades), credits (used in the Arcade mode), repairs, stars (which grant achievements), extra time (for the Arcade mode) and flaming tires (which give the car extra grip).\n\nThe game features 6 single player game modes:\n<ul><li>Career: in this mode, the player competes in 8 tournaments including 2 to 5 tracks, earning money to buy new cars and upgrades for them. There are 6 cars available to be purchased.</li>\n<li>Time Attack: in this mode, the player runs against the clock.</li>\n<li>Single Race: in this mode, the player selects a track and runs against A.I. opponents.</li>\n<li>Instant Race: in this mode, the player picks up a random car and a random track to race on.</li>\n<li>Survival: in this mode, the player in the last position at each lap is eliminated.</li>\n<li>Arcade: in this mode, the player races through all stages trying not to let the clock reach zero.</li></ul>\nIt features also online multiplayer gameplay (for the smartphones version only).",

      "description": "<i>Darkwind: War on Wheels</i> is a wargame in a persistent world that is best described as a hybrid game, taking elements out of Autoduel (car customizations), EVE Online (sandbox elements) and other assorted games like Jagged Alliance (gang roster with individual traits and needs), interactive fiction (text quests) and Interstate 76 (physics and locational damage). Played on a client-and-browser combination, you get to trade (with a dynamically changing market system), be a pirate, make a mark for yourself in town events like deathraces and combat arenas, or even open your own factory or farm as an entrepreneur!\n\nClient-based events include anything that involves shooting or driving, such as racing and scouting. The events are played out in phases, with each phase typically lasting 30 seconds or less if players are fast to end turn. Instead of watching the cars move linearly, the game has its own built in physics system to allow for complex car movements - moving at too fast a speed may result in the car skidding off the road or even flipping; likewise being hit by rockets for two consecutive turns may flip your car over, even throwing it high into the air if it is a lightweight chassis. Throw in the fact that characters can die in horribly violent ways (expressed through text) and the existence of perma-death, and you have a brutal, post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nThe browser is where you manage your gang members, purchase items, set travel routes and manage your camps (player-owned sites).",

      "description": "<i>Rage</i> is id Software's first major first-person-shooter since Doom 3, and the debut of the id Tech 5 game engine.  Tech 5's major feature is use of Megatexture technology, essentially allowing for more efficient use of limited memory.  As such, <i>Rage</i> is the first id game created predominately with consoles in mind.\n\n<i>Rage</i> takes place an unspecified time after an asteroid strikes the Earth and obliterates all life.  The player is a member of the \"Ark Project\" - a massive undertaking prior to the meteor's impact that placed valuable personnel into underground pods.  The pods were meant to keep these VIPs in stasis until the impact's effects had passed, and then release their crew out to repopulate the world.  The player awakens as the sole survivor of their damaged pod, and many decades after society had already started to rebuild.  The player thus sets off to assist what settlements they find, and avoid The Authority - a mysterious governing force that wants to capture the player to harvest the nanites placed in their body as part of the Ark Project.\n\nSettlements and similar playable areas are connected by an overworld called The Wasteland.  The player gains access to buggy-style vehicles to traverse the wastes, and can also engage in specific races and vehicle combat.  Players take missions from job boards and friendly NPCs, drive to the appropriate area, and use traditional FPS skills to dispatch any enemies and/or retrieve necessary trinkets from the enemy's lair.  The player's health regenerates when not taking damage, and should the player be knocked out, they have a limited charge of defibrillators (activated through a brief minigame) to revive themselves.\n\nCharacter progression is not present, and the player learns no extra skills.  However, they can purchase and upgrade both vehicles and weapons.  A one-time choice of armor also allows the player to pick one permanent bonus.  Objects can be looted throughout the mission areas of the Wasteland, and are clearly marked as junk, useable, or crafting items in the player's inventory.  Crafting can be done from anywhere, and is a simple matter of having the right recipe and the necessary parts - both of which can be bought or found.  Crafted objects include lockpicks, ammo, bandages, lethal boomerangs called \"Wingsticks,\" and more elaborate gear like sentry turrets and controllable RC bomb cars.\n\nThe player can also earn money through various minigames around the wastes.  These include participating in an racing circuit, taking part in an arena battle called \"Mutant Bash TV,\" and playing a simplified holographic board game.  A collectable card game is also featured, with the player able to find new cards hidden in the wastes.  The player builds a deck before each game and pits it directly against the cards of their opponent.\n\n<i>Rage</i> features no traditional \"deathmatch\" multiplayer.  Instead, competitive multiplayer takes place entirely through vehicle-based modes similar to those in the main game.  Players drive armed buggies against their opponents in various racing and collection challenges.  Players can rank up in multiplayer, granting access to new vehicles, weapons, and boost items.  Cooperative multiplayer offers a variety of \"Legends\" to play online or local split-screen.  These are short stories based on characters and areas from the single player game, which have no impact on the single player campaign itself. ",

      "description": "<i>Driver: San Francisco</i> is an entry in the long-running action racing series. The story, which is entirely different from the Wii version of the same name, takes place six months after the events in Driv3r. Protagonist undercover cop John Tanner and antagonist Charles Jericho have both survived the final shootout in Istanbul. Jericho is facing sentencing after being tried in San Francisco, but escapes his prison van. He is chased down by Tanner and his partner Tobias Jones. During the pursuit, Tanner's vehicle is struck by a Big Rig and he ends up in the hospital in a coma. The majority of the game takes place in Tanner's coma-induced dream where he continues to track down Jericho.\n\nThe player has access to the entire city of San Francisco with the freedom to explore it without boundaries. Players can choose to follow the main storyline, where Tanner gradually learns he is actually in a dream, or take on the many vignette-like missions with mini-stories along with regular races and stunts, even participating in the recording of a movie stunt scene for instance. There are many different licensed cars to collect, with 140 types ranging from Volkswagen to Lamborghini. A return to the gameplay of the original Driver, players are no longer able to exit the vehicle or explore on foot. The entire game takes place inside a car. Streets are filled with traffic and often certain obstacles can be used to perform stunts. Pedestrians can never be hit, they dive out of the way. Next to the main driving controls players can boost and perform ram attacks on cars. Footage of the racing can be captured in the film director mode, which was absent in the previous game Driver: Parallel Lines.\n\nEntirely new to the series is the ability to Shift. Since Tanner is in a dream, he discovers he is able to dive into the body of any other driver in the city. During chases or when losing the tail in a pursuit, this allows him to quickly jump into the body of another car's driver and continue from there, often to the horror of the passengers. There are many conversations during the racing, and the characters are shown through portraits near the top of the screen. Shifting adds a new dimension to car chases as one crash does not mean the end of a pursuit. The technique can also be used to crash cars in front of the opponent to create additional obstacles, put trucks in the way, and travel to the other side of the city in a few seconds. His nemesis Jericho is however also able to Shift, and he can even take over Tanner's body when he has moved out of it.\n\nMultiplayer is available both offline and online with different competitive and cooperative game modes. Players can for instance work together to escape from the police or take down a street racers team. Shifting is also available in multiplayer, but is disabled for certain technical races.",

      "description": "<i>DiRT: Showdown</i> is an entry in the <i>DiRT</i> racing series and unlike the previous titles it is less of a rally game and focuses more on short circuit tracks with public in the stands, a commentator, a larger scope of vehicles, and action-based gameplay. The main game mode is constructed through a tour system; a series of events and races where winning opens up new challenges and provides prize money to acquire new vehicles op upgrade them. Next to classic racing many tracks are filled with debris, there is boost available and often other vehicles need to be damaged. Unlike previous games most cars are fictional. Real cars can only be used for certain events.\n\nThe main game modes are divided over four categories: Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan and Party.<ul>\n<li>Racing includes different events with regular circuit racing, point-based racing where a circuit is divided into sectors with points for the fastest time in each, and elimination where a timer counts down eliminating the last driver until one remain. In this mode there are often obstacles and debris on the track.</li><br>\n<li>Demolition is centered around taking out opponents, either in a regular bowl head-to-head (Rampage), or on an elevated track where other cars can be knocked off (Knock Out). There is also a survival mode (Hard Target) where the player's car is targeted by the others, and 8-Ball as a circuit race with multiple crossovers where cars can collide.</li><br>\n<li>Hoonigan is similar to the Gymkhana mode from DiRT 3. The goal is to score points by performing tricks, either alone (Trick Rush) or against an opponent (Head 2 Head). A third mode is Smash Hunter where the car needs to smash through bricks of the team's colour and avoid the other ones.</li><br>\n<li>Party is only available in multiplayer. It contains Smash & Grab where a team can grab loot and needs to hold on to it. It is lost when an opponent hits the car. Transporter is regular capture-the-flag, and Speed Skirmish is a time-based event where checkpoints need to be reached in any order.</li></ul>The game offers split-screen multiplayer for two players and up to eight players online. It includes the Racenet social service to track statistics and there is a Crashback replay function to capture crashes and upload them directly to YouTube.",

They include checkpoint races and fetch quests where zines need to be collected. The game focuses on exploring the environment by employing tricks. These are not rewarded, but different techniques are needed to move through areas without losing speed and to reach specific platforms. The character can be steered in any direction, use ramps to jump, do wall rides, grind on rails etc. During a jump air control can be applied to maneuver. Going downhill, gravity can be applied to gain more speed. There are no opponents or means of attack. At any moment time can be rewound manually to retry a missed jump or to return to an earlier location.",

      "description": "Five years after The Destroyer was vanquished, a new valuable mineral known as Eridian was discovered in the crust of the planet Pandora. The powerful Hyperion Corporation, led by Handsome Jack, secured a moon base and eventually occupied the entire planet, depriving it of Eridian. One day, four vault hunters fall into a trap prepared by Jack, but are rescued by a ClapTrap robot and shown the way to a resistance movement that tries to put an end to Hyperion's regime.\n\n<i>Borderlands 2</i>, like its predecessor,  is a first-person shooter that incorporates character building, quests and procedural content generation elements from role-playing games, particularly roguelikes, along with vehicle-based gameplay from contemporary shooters. The sequel features four new characters embodying four classes that represent different special skills and weapon affinities. Accumulated experience points result in skill points, which can then be allocated to the nodes of one of three skill trees that vary between classes. Weapons differ not only by type, firing speed or damage, they can also cause elemental damage that is more or less effective against specific types of opponents.\n\nPlayers can take on the game's challenges by themselves, or enlist the help of other players in the cooperative multiplayer mode. Compared to the first game, the game world is not split into disjunct pieces anymore, but has become continuously connected. Non-player characters now follow their own schedules and agendas as opposed to being fixed in their position permanently. ",

      "description": "<i>Retro City Rampage</i> is an open-world game inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series that combines driving with fighting and shooting in a retro 8-bit style. Originally started as a homebrew NES demake of Grand Theft Auto III, it was eventually developed into a full game. The game is set in eighties and the protagonist is a mullet-styled gangster who wreaks havoc in Theftropolis city. It draws many elements from the series it was inspired by, such as the ability to hijack any car, fight on foot with melee and ranged weapons, and shake off the law when too many crimes are committed.\n\nThe main story mode consists of a number of missions that involve heists, extortion, but for instance also helping out Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movies to help repair his time travel car. The game has a quirky style and hectic pace, and is filled to the brim references to popular culture, especially movies, celebrities and other games with many cameo appearances. Next to the main mission various side missions can be taken on or the city can be explored in full at the player's leisure. During certain parts 30 challenges can be triggered where an objective needs to be completed in a short time, such as driving around a tank or getting air time shooting a bazooka. These can later be replayed as arcade challenges from the main menu. In addition there is a free roaming mode with the maximum amount of money right from the start.\n\nThe protagonist, dubbed The Player, can fight with his fists and other melee weapons, or shoot a large variety of guns. There are about 25 in total. These are collected while playing or are bought in shops. There is also a cover system where it is possible to duck behind objects and fire quickly. Any car or bike of the 40 available can be taken over and pedestrians can be mowed down, leaving behind money. The gun targeting has a lock system where it is possible to strafe around an opponent without losing the target direction. Other options include the ability to jump, and pick up and throw objects, including pedestrians. Committing too many crimes raises a threat meter causing the police force to arrive in increasingly larger numbers. The main character can buy various customizations, play arcade games or gamble at the casino. There are five special, permanent power-ups such as \"Speed 'Kills' Shoes\" for faster speed that are discovered or bought throughout the game. Vehicles can be repainted at spray garages, but cops can also be shaken off by collecting cop cloaking devices that make them lose the trail. Health is replenished by collecting hearts or buying food at vending machines.\n\nIn November 2014 <i>Retro City Rampage: DX</i> was launched, a new version for all previous platforms and introducing new platforms. It is a re-mastered version with the ability to switch to the original version of the game in the options. It was originally launched as the initial version for the 3DS platform earlier that year. Changes include faster vehicles, more checkpoints, tutorials, hint screens and tweaked missions, challenges, visual effects, visual enhancements and difficulty. Weapons can be selected from a grid instead of cycling through them and there is a new UI for the handheld version, including zoom, touch and a dynamic camera. There are more video filters options and two additional graphics modes: RETRO+ and 8-BIT. Weapons have been rebalanced and it is now possible to jump right away after shooting. The update also introduces parking garages where 54 cars can be parked.",

The game features all twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season (except for mid-season changes), as well as the twenty circuits and Grands Prix\u2014including the brand new Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe Grand Prix mode featured in previous games, which allowed players to play a season as one of the real pilots, has been removed in favor of some enhancements to the Career mode. In addition, new game modes have been added. Champions mode challenges the player to complete several scenarios that usually involve finishing ahead of one of the previous F1 world champions, while Young Driver Test acts like a tutorial for new players with a series of videos and tests. Also new is the Season Challenge mode, a shorter, fast-paced career in which the player may frequently swap to a different car constructor by challenging rivals. The qualifying sessions are now optionally shorter with the new One-shot Qualifying mode, in which only the first lap is retained valid for placement.",

      "description": "<i>Kavinsky</i> is an action game based around the 2013 studio album <i>OutRun</i> by the French electronic musician Kavinsky. The album itself is named after the 1986 SEGA racing game OutRun. As his electro music is influenced by the video games and television cop shows of that era, the game has the same eighties vibe and aesthetics accompanied by the artist's music. The protagonist of the game is also Kavinsky himself and it set in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe game consists of eight levels and at the launch of the game four were available for the PC versions and six for the mobile versions. Levels have different gameplay mechanic based on three game types. The first type of level is a side-scrolling beat'em up reminiscent of the Streets of Rage games. Kavinsky travels through a street and needs to beat up thugs and a boss at the end. He can be moved around and has two types of attacks: a punch and a kick. Health can be replenished by picking up items such as cigarettes. Some of these are hidden in objects such as trashcans that need to be destroyed. Attacks fill up a combo meter. Once full, a blue glow appears around the character and his attacks become stronger. When it is kept up, a powerful special move with a series of punches and kicks is performed. Combo can also be activated by picking up a dirty magazine. At the end of the level there is a tougher boss. In these levels there are three types of perspectives: a 3D view with a fixed camera somewhere between a side view and over the shoulder, a fixed 3D sideview, and a retro 16-bit render with scanlines. The latter can also be activated by standing in front of a <i>Kavinsky</i> arcade machine. Then it becomes possible to play the entire level as seen from an arcade machine screen. There are two levels of this variant in the game.\n\nThe second type of level is a driving game. Kavinsky drives his iconic sports car through an environment where thugs chase him and cops attempt to stop him. He has to drive through roadblocks and catch the checkpoints before time runs out <i>OutRun</i>-style. Additional time can be acquired by picking up certain items. Hitting the sides of the road slows down the car. There are multiple perspectives in this racing mode and there are two levels of this variant in the game. On mobile devices players can choose between on-screen arrows to steer or using the accelerometer/gyroscope.\n\nThe third type of level is only available to mobile versions of the game. It is a beat'em-up level similar to the first type and with the same gameplay mechanics, but seen from a top-down perspective. In this game mode Kavinsky needs to defend his car against thugs that attempt to beat it up. If his car is destroyed, the level is lost. This game mode relies on an augmented reality mode to play the game against any background in the player's own environment. Tilting the device is then used to look around in the environment.",

      "description": "<i>Rush Bros.</i> is a platform racing game that reacts to the music played by the racers. It features a single player mode (allowing players to learn the levels and race against their own ghost data) and a competitive multiplayer mode, either local split-screen or online between two simultaneous racers (it supports cross-platform competition between PC and Mac gamers).\n\nThe 45+ platform racing tracks feature a reactive level design where the music you play directly affects the movement of traps, obstacles and backgrounds. Particular to the game are power-downs that reverse the other player's controls or that flip their screen.\n\nGamers can play with their own MP3 or OGG music library, or with included musical tracks by Infected Mushroom, Xilent, Dead Day Revolution, Black Parrot and Animal Music.",

      "description": "<i>Joe Danger 2: The Movie</i> is the sequel to the game  Joe Danger. In this game, the player controls Joe Danger, stuntman extraordinary, through various stages. The whole game centres around various movie themes. Many, many tropes and clich\u00e9s of famous movies get used in the different stages. The game has no story to speak of, but the different levels and stage are supposedly used to created a comprehensive film. \n\nThe gameplay in this game could roughly be described as \"side-scrolling arcade racing game\" (Or Excitebike on crystal meth). Joe Danger progresses a level on a fix axis from right to left (which in some levels can be switched) while avoiding crashes, making stunts and trying to collect different objects. The game is played very fast, with repeated failures and restarts already thought of in the design, as a single button press lets you restart the current stage. Various vehicles or other equipment are used by Joe, ranging from a unicycle to a jetpack. While simply finishing a stage lets the player usually progress, completing several tasks throughout a stage nets the player \"stars\" which are required to unlock higher levels. Competitive leaderboard based gaming is also encouraged, with \"ghosts\" of other players being (optionally) visible throughout the race. \n\nThe game features a vast cast unlockable characters, which can be used instead of Joe. Additionally a level editor called \"movie maker\" is included. 4 player simultaneous multiplayer is available, but only possible locally. ",

      "description": "<i>Asphalt 6: Adrenaline</i> is an entry in the arcade racing series. It offers races for 42 licensed cars for locations all around the world including Cape Town, Chamonix, Havana, Los Angeles, Monte Carlo, Moscow, Nassau, New Orleans, New York City, Reykjav\u00edk, Shanghai and Tokyo. The Android version has additional venues exclusive to the platform: Detroit, Hong Kong and Rio de Janeiro. At the start a limited amount of vehicles is available (Abarth 500 SS, DeLorean DMC-12, MINI John Cooper Works and Nissan Nizmo 370Z) and additional ones, including motorcycles, are unlocked by completing events. Most of them can be tuned along with customized colours.\n\nProgression through the game is done through different types of events. There are Regular Races where a third place is needed to qualify, Beat'em All where opponents need to be knocked down as much as possible in a limited time frame, Elimination where the last racer is removed after a set amount of time repeated, Time Attack, Drift (also against a time limit), Duel (only one opponent), Collector where items need to be collected against a time limit and Under Pressure where other racers attempt to destroy you. \n\nThe distinct feature for this entry is the Adrenaline mode from the title. When the nitro meter is hit when filled up completely by racing through nitro symbols, double tapping (for touch based devices) provides an extreme speed boost and gives the screen a blue-tinted blur. On mobile devices the game can be controlled by tilting the device for steering along with auto-acceleration. Tapping the left side of the screen activates braking and tapping the right side activates boost. Drifting is done by tapping the brake while turning and another tap stops the drift. Successful races usually require mastering drifts, ramming rivals and using short-cuts. Multiplayer is available locally through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and online multiplayer is supported as well.",
