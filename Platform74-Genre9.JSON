      "description": "A platform shooter from Japan, <i>Thexder</i> offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.",

This Lost Treasure of Babylon is being guarded by the evil dragon Ryu. While the gameplay is basically the same as the other versions, the story for the Famicom version is different. It involves Karnov, who comes from a small town called Cleamina, being called by God to be his envoy. Karnov is tasked with getting rid of the evil troublemaker known as Alakatai.\n\n<i>Karnov</i> features nine stages of side-scrolling action.  Karnov's main attack is to breathe fireballs at his enemies.  Karnov can collect power-up orbs which can increase the amount of fire he can breathe out. Karnov is also able to jump, with the height being increased by collecting boots. Other items Karnov can carry and use include bombs, ladders, boomerangs, clappers (which destroy minor enemies that are currently on the screen instantaneously), and shields. Occasionally, Karnov will be able to make use of certain items such as wings which let him fly in the air and a scuba gear helmet which lets him swim underwater. Also, scattered throughout the stages are K icons. Collecting 50 of these will reward Karnov an extra life.",

      "description": "Following an on-going war with the alien Ur-Quan race, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds. However, unknown to the Ur-Quan, a small research vessel had been lost during the war while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel, one of the largest vessels in the galaxy.\n\nUpon return, the captain of the ship discovers, to his dismay, that Earth has become one of Ur-Quan's slave planets. The surface of Earth is glowing red, devoid of life, and a few humans are locked in a starbase orbiting the planet. The captain contacts the starbase commander and finds out that the only way to defeat the Ur-Quan is to convince other races populating the galaxy to join them in their struggle.\n\n<i>Star Control II</i> is a hybrid game based on exploration, space combat, and ship customization. Unlike its predecessor, it has a heavily plot-driven, quest-based structure reminiscent of role-playing or adventure games. The game's main focus is on exploring a vast galaxy consisting of numerous star systems and interacting with various alien species populating it. Each species has their own personal traits and would usually require the player to exploit conversation trees or perform different tasks to convince them to join. The main objective is to gather as many allies as possible, though only a few alliances are required to complete the game. \n\nWhile in deep space, the starship can approach any star it comes across, and then the player can guide the ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows the player to set the ship on auto-pilot to any star. \n\nThroughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or engaged in combat.\n\nAlongside the main plot objective, the player also configures and upgrades his fleet in a role-playing fashion. The main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems, which uses up fuel. Raw materials are used as currency to make purchases in the starbase. It is possible to buy fuel, as well as improve the player-controlled fleet in various ways. These include purchasing smaller ships to accompany the main one on its travels and participate in combat; hiring crew members, which effectively act as the hit points of the ships; and upgrading the main ship with enhancements that improve its speed, maneuverability, and combat efficiency. Successfully completing a quest for an alien race may also result in their combat ships joining the fleet.\n\nRaw materials are found on surfaces of planets and moons throughout the galaxy. The player has to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up materials found earlier with a scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava, which can damage or destroy landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets and explored. \n\nCombat is action-based and utilizes the same engine as the first game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel has unique abilities, and the player can select any ship from his fleet to participate in battles, attempting to find the best combination against specific enemies. Combat can also be played as a standalone game (melee mode), separate from the main storyline. It can also be set on a cyborg mode within the main game, allowing the computer AI to take over the battles and calculate their results depending on the attributes of the ships.",

      "description": "<i>Star Wars: Rebel Assault</i> is an arcade flight/shooting game based on the original Star Wars trilogy. Players control Rebel recruit Rookie One (who can be set to have either a male or female voice) in combat against the Empire. Story events (which don't follow the films to the letter but instead offer their own interpretation and characters) include Rookie One's basic training, an Imperial assault on Tatooine, the battle of Hoth from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and the Death Star battle from <i>A New Hope</i>. Players will control four different Star Wars craft: Skyhoppers, A-Wings, X-Wings and Snowspeeders.\n\nThe game's fifteen levels encompass navigating canyons, caves and asteroid fields, battles against TIE Fighters in space, attacks against a Star Destroyer and an Imperial Walker, a battle on foot against stormtroopers and the famous Death Star trench run. There are three different types of flight sequences: seen from either behind the own craft, from an overhead perspective or from a first-person cockpit view. All follow an 'on-rails' model, utilizing motion video backdrops displaying pre-rendered environments. The third-person levels allow some degree of free movement to dodge obstacles, while the first-person levels limit movement to a minimum, mostly requiring accurate shooting instead. Some levels offer a choice of branching paths. The on-foot level takes place on static screens, with Rookie One seen from behind, stormtroopers moving in from side corridors, and the player being able to take steps to the side to avoid enemy fire. The game features a password system - a password is given after every level in the console ports, but only after a group of levels in the PC version.",

It features smooth scrolling VGA graphics, a variety of enemies on ground, air and sea, and an original soundtrack.\n\nAfter completing each level you have the option of upgrading your ship with a powerful arsenal of weapons and goodies. Some weapons are effective on only ground or air targets, while some are on both. There are some really advanced weapons like the auto-track mini-gun which can effectively destroy almost any kind of targets without aiming the ship.\n\nDying in shoot'em ups can be annoying, especially if you have to start all over the beginning. However, in Raptor you can save your game between each level. If you have enough credit you can even buy multiple shields for further protection.\n\nThe 2010 edition of <i>Raptor: Call of the Shadows</i> includes improved graphics and native support for higher resolutions (640x400, 960x600 and 1280x800). Standard graphics are also available. ",

      "description": "In <i>Fury of the Furries</i>, you control a cute, round creature called Tiny, who must defeat \"the wicked one\" who has captured the King, and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters. Fortunately your Tiny has special powers. It can transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter or rope swinger during its quest.\n\nThe game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village and the Castle. When you manage to get through them, the last one awaits: The Machine which seems to be some sort of a way to get out of here. This level is not a typical stage after stage approach. Each screen has several exist that can either bring you closer to or further from the end of the game.\n\nFor the US release the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed : the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. ",

      "description": "Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.\r\n\r\nYou are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.\r\n\r\nThe game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....\r\n\r\nLastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of \"Classic Asteroids\" now appearing on the main menu.",

      "description": "Following his successes for the Rebel Alliance in the previous game, the adventures of the starfighter pilot \"Rookie One\" continue. While out scouting in the Dreighton Nebula, Rookie One's patrols receive a distress call from a freighter. As this is an area where ships are known to disappear, any deviation from the flight path is dangerous. But what they find is an Imperial presence where there shouldn't be one... and a new secret project to bring about the destruction of the Rebel Alliance.\n\n<i>Rebel Assault II</i> is a rail-shooter \"interactive movie\" featuring a variety of action sequences. Rookie One will fly sequences in an X-Wing, the Millennium Falcon, speeder bikes and being on foot. His only real ability is the precise targeting and shooting of laser weapon and occasionally the chance to take cover and avoid obstacles. Rookie One will team up with other characters who will aid him and need to be defended in turn. Occasionally different paths can be chosen in the animation and different events triggered, but for the most part the game is a closed environment.",

      "description": "The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed \"Material Defender\", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.\n\n<i>Descent</i> is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. <i>Descent</i> is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).\n\nThe goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.",

To stop them profiting form their dubious actions you must get across America as quickly as possible. This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 MPH.\n\nThere are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around. The police are after you - pay attention to the sirens and stay out of their way.",

It is essentially the same game with an additional new episode (Hazudra Fodder), a revised engine (less bugs and better controls) and added Windows support. It also adds another option called \"Timed Battle\".\n\nTyrian is nothing like your run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. It gained a following even larger than the classic Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and rightfully so: it has a plot. A plot, you ask? Yes. And even a complex one. You play the role of Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing MicroSol.\n\nTyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play. It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls, decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and generators and even add ship \"sidekicks\". Tyrian's complete arsenal amound to over a dozen type of ships and over 100 weapon types!",

Not that it is difficult to play, rather that you could never build a pinball machine that could do the type of things that this game does.  But it seems as though that's the point.  As like any pinball game, there is an underlying plot in which you must achieve certain goals on each of the three pinball tables (you can warp between them).\r\n\r\nThis takes you off into the fantasy pinball world, where anything can happen.  Tanks can attack your ball, comets can fly in and create a crater in the middle of the board.  Who knows what will happen next.",

      "description": "The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.\n\nThe game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.\n\nBy the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and <i>Arkanoid</i> features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.",

However, his luck changes when he is chosen as the hero who must venture into a mysterious Labyrinth in the overworld and retrieve the Pizza of Plenty from there, so that his demonic friends will have enough capers and anchovies to eat.\n\n<i>Litil Divil</i> has puzzle-solving and action elements, including platforming and combat. Mutt is being transported to various puzzle rooms, where he has to avoid obstacles, fight enemies, and manipulate the environment in order to succeed. It is also possible to buy items such as weapons and shields at specific locations.",

Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.\n\nThe road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.",

      "description": "<i>Gauntlet</i> is an action game where players choose characters and fight their way through hordes of enemies that assault them on the way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. \n\nThe game features a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.\n\nGhosts, goblins and even the life-draining Death are among the enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. \n\nKeys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces the character's energy level.\nTreasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to the player's score.",

      "description": "<i>Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time</i> is an interactive CD-ROM with minigames, screen savers, desktop wallpaper and icons mainly based on <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i> TV series.\n\nbased on the world of Monty Python. Including a game to discover the secret to Intergalactic Success, the Desktop Pythonizer, and an Interactive Monty Python Show.\n\nThe game's main menu takes the form of a brain with six sections:\n<ul>\n<li>The Exploding TV Room has, like most areas of the game, multiple hotspots which trigger animations, audio clips or minigames. The main focus in this area is the TV which shows clips from the TV series.</li>\n<li>The Portrait Gallery shows three pictures on the wall. Clicking on these triggers a video clip but just leave them alone and the clips will be shown anyway along with other animated effects. In addition to the pictures there are other hotspots on the frames and the wall.</li>\n<li>Corridor starts with the \"Big Head\" spouting all kinds of objects after which a click anywhere on the background will trigger a video clip. In the upper left of the screen is an On/Off button which toggles between the video mode and a pinball game set inside medieval archways/</li>\n<li>The Loonatorium has multiple hotspots and the <i>Spot the Loony</i> minigame which is a <i>Whac-A-Mole variant</i>.</li>\n<li>Try Your Skill section has three mini games:\n<ul><li>The <i>Chicken/Bird</i> Game is a mouse/keyboard controlled game. On the left of the screen is a mouth which opens and closes, on the right a man/chicken hybrid is launched across the screen and the object is to land the bird in the mouth.</li>\n<li>The <i>Gopher Game</i> is another <i>Whac-A-Mole variant</i>.</li>\n<li>The <i>Pig Game</i> is a keyboard shooter game. A big pink pig flies across the top of the screen above a cowboy. The cowboy shoots the pig, which splits into three, and scores points for also shooting the little pigs. If any of the three little pigs falls to earth and the cowboy walks on them he loses points. In addition the flying pig poops and each plop that hits the ground turns into some kind of rabid attack piglet that attacks the cowboy, whose only defence is to jump on them because if he doesn't they will kill him.</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Pythoniser which is a set of windows customisation options\n<ul>\n<li>The Noisy Bits is a selection of sound files that can be used to tweak Windows bleeps and whistles. It is divided into four sections: Windows Events, Apppropriate Commentary, Telephone Answering Machine Messages and Keyboard Events.</li>\n<li>O.L.E Animations contains over thirty video clips that feature in the main title. These all play in a small window in the centre of the screen.</li>\n<li>Wallpapers.<ul>\n<li>Over twenty-five Living Wallpapers, most of which are interactive and are practically minigames, mostly shooters.</li>\n<li>Around fifty static images.</li></ul>\n<li>Screensavers: non-interactive versions of the Living Wallpapers.</li>\n<li>Forty-eight Icons that the user can install and assign to their Windows programs</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\nAmong the shown clips are many classic ones, such as the \"The Dirty Vicar\", \"Nudge, Nudge\", \"The Dead Parrot\" and \"The Lumberjack Song\".\n\n\n",

      "description": "The action has moved on 500 years since the original game, Z, and an uneasy cease-fire exists between the two vast war machines of TransGlobal Industries and the MegaCom Corporation. The final phase of the peace initiative is only hours away when an incident takes place, which throws this short-lived truce into complete disarray.\r\n\r\nWar is firmly back on the agenda.\r\n\r\nWhile initial thoughts may be that Z: Steel Soldiers is another recruit to the growing army of real time strategy games, Z: Steel Soldiers should be viewed as an arcade strategy title with the emphasis firmly on action, the players\u2019 combat decisions and their subsequent consequences.\r\n\r\nThe taking of territory is still paramount for victory as buildings can only be constructed on land owned by the player. But now, gamers must also think about which territory will best suit their strategy. \r\n\r\nEach sector on the map will feature a flag displaying a number from 1 to 5, the higher the number the quicker the game\u2019s resource, Xenonite, will be mined. The temptation may well be to secure those territories that will deliver the most Xenonite so forces can be quickly built up. But the game\u2019s 3D environments mean that some territories will be strategically better than others. So, taking control of high ground with a relatively small yield of Xenonite may well prove more advantageous in the long term than quickly snatching a valley based territory with low strategic value and a high resource yield.\r\n\r\nThe action in Z: Steel Soldiers takes place in six very distinct worlds each with its own unique environment. From arid desert to lush forest each throws up its own geographical challenges for the player. In addition each world has its own environmental systems and specific life forms.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s different environments have meant that Z: Steel Soldiers will feature not only land based units but also naval and airforce which includes helicopters and jets. In total players will have access to up to 30 units, the hardware becoming more powerful and destructive as the player progresses through the game.\r\n\r\nDesigned from the ground up as a true 3D game it comes as no surprise that Z: Steel Soldiers features a state of the art engine that really brings the game\u2019s worlds to life.  Units will make tracks in soft ground or kick up dust on dry terrain and all objects are subject to real time shadows and reflections. Other natural effects such as weather and transitions from day to night are incredibly realistic thanks to the game\u2019s physics system. \r\n\r\nZ: Steel Soldiers is more than a number of isolated missions with no structure thrown together to make a game. It features a progressive plot driven story line written by Martin Pond, the man responsible for bringing the world of Medievil and the universe of Imperium Galactica 2 to life. Full of intrigue and conspiracy, the story will be updated through luscious cut scenes created by leading industry lights AudioMotion.\r\n\r\nCited as one of Z\u2019s strongest attributes, the AI in Z: Steel Soldiers is even more complex yet flexible enough to respond to gamers of all levels. It can be passive or aggressive in its nature from reinforcing territories to scouting or manufacturing of units in response to the player\u2019s situation.",

Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.\n\nEach vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.",

      "description": "<i>Bugatron</i> is a Galaga-styled shoot 'em up game where the player must shoot down armies of insects. The enemies typically fly onto the screen in spirals, and tend to pirouette all over the screen during the gameplay; depending on the level they might shoot at the player's ship or not. Some levels also contain unique gameplay elements, for example the enemies can only be destroyed by pushing them off their flight path into an obstacle, or the player must maneouver through a narrow path in one piece. Destroying the enemies occasionally causes pick-ups to appear, with both positive (new weapons, extra life, faster ship, larger enemies) and negative (slowdown, slower weapon, less controllable ship, smaller enemies) effects.

There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  \n\nThis is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike. This mode uses passwords allowing players to continue a previously played game. ",

Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.\n\n<i>Sonic 3D</i> was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right. \n\nGameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. \nUnlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.",

In critical situations, the meek Dexter can transform into his mighty alter ego Space Ace. Thus empowered, he has to defeat Borf\u2019s minions.\r\n\r\n<I>Space Ace II</I> is a essentially a cartoon strip in which our hero will encounter numerous hazards. You have to avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly, you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes requires one to three keystrokes. If your decision is wrong, the cartoon will end with a death animation, and Dexter will lose one of his three lives. So you\u2019re basically trying to keep the strip running. Timing is crucial; you will need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, you\u2019re allowed to save your progress at four fixed points.\r\n\r\n<I>Space Ace II</I> is ported to the PC from the original arcade Laserdisc version. The result is a cut version due to space restraints. Although <I>Space Ace II</I> comes on 12(!) low density 5 1/4\" discs, most scenes are shortened noticeably. ",

It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms.\n\nYou take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.\n\nThe game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.",

Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded \"unbeatable\"(?) pterodactyl.\n\nThe game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.",

Due to a lack of disk and memory space in the systems of the day, the port of the arcade game, <i>Dragon's Lair</i> was split into two parts. The first part covered the half of the game dealing with entering Singe's Castle and saving the Princess. This second part, named <i>Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle</i> completes the game, continuing the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon.\n\nDirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.",

Grab the cola, cupcakes, ice cream, and hula-hoops while avoiding spiders, broccoli, frogs, and mean sisters. Each platform you land on grabs you one point, but watch your yukk-o-meter!</li><br>\n<li><i>Fish Shtick</i>: Unscramble the letters before the clock reaches 0! Collect as many points as you can and get a high score! One point for four-letter words, two for 5-letter words, three for 6-letter words, etc.</li><br>\n<li><i>Roof Rats</i>: Get everyone off the roof and leave yourself with as few rooms remaining as possible. Eliminate rooms by putting two-or-more of the same colour together and double-clicking. Each person has their own number of floors that they can jump off of. The grannie has to be on ground level, the rat can jump off of 1 floor, the dog - 2 floors, the pogo-boy - 3 floors, the boxing kangaroo - 4 floors, the buff man - 5 floors.</li><br>\n<li><i>Solitaire</i>: No twists here, just a simple game of Klondike.</li><br>\n<li><i>Roger Dodger</i>: You control a glowing orb that needs to collect power-ups (green) and then make its way to the pulsing green gateway. Avoid red things; they'll kill you!</li><br>\n<li><i>Zapper:</i> Standard trivia; yes-or-no questions. Every time you get three-in-a-row correct and your time will increase, as well as the jackpot (third) point level.</li><br>\n<li><i>Mowin' Maniac</i>: Can you say Pac-Man? That's all this game is: a variant with a lawnmower theme.</li><br>\n<li><i>Bad Dog 911</i>: Using six letters, create as many words as you can before time runs out! Every \"real\" word will move the scaffolding closer to you, but the clock is ticking! When it's half-past and you haven't gotten the scaffolding yet, you die!</li><br>\n<li><i>Toaster Run</i>: Ah, the little toaster that was the first in a series of infamous screen savers. Now the little toaster is on a mission to gather all the toys and put the child in bed. Hitting an object causes the toaster to lose power; bread increases it. Watch out for the TV! The static really hurts!</li><br>\n<li><i>Foggy Boxes</i>: Dots in disguise. Unfortunately, you can only play against the computer.</li><br>\n<li><i>MooShu</i>: The classic game of MahJongg, carried all the way from China! Select two tiles of matching design that are free on either the left or right and they disappear! Win by removing all the tiles.</li></ul>",

You crash landed on an inhospitable planet, and thus you set out to get back to a ship so you can leave this horrible place. To make it, you'll blast hundreds upon hundreds of nasty creatures, enemy bounty hunters, and you'll use some pretty impressive weaponry to do it.\n\nYou'll also get to buy power ups and get help from the goofy local troll-like natives, to solve puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay consists of running, jumping and shooting, with a big emphasis on shooting. The action is very gory, and is akin to DOOM in 2D. ",

Dr. Brown extracted four Mystical Gems, the android's power source, and sealed them on one of the planet's moons, where it was guarded by the four Gunstar siblings. However, years later, a dictator named Smash Daisaku kidnapped Gunstar Green and brainwashed him into telling him where the Mystical Gems were. The dictator is now close to reactivating Golden Silver. The Gunstar twins Red and Blue, guided by their sister Yellow, must find a way to stop Smash Daisaku - but they know that their older brother is on that way...\n\n<i>Gunstar Heroes</i> is a fast-paced side-scrolling shooter. Controlling either Red or Blue Gunstar, the player has access to four basic weapons: Force, rapid shot; Lightning, a straight shot that penetrates enemies; Chaser, a homing weapon; and Flame, a powerful close-ranged. The player can combine two weapons to produce a new one, for a total of fourteen weapons. It is also possible to use melee attacks and moves such as grabbing and tossing enemies, jumping, and sliding.",

      "description": "The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, <i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters '99. This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.\n\n<i>The King of Fighters 2000</i> features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the \"alternate\" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden \"maniac\" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.",

You have to manage your island (strategy), fight against a lot of enemies from your different turrets (arcade), walk around, cast spells (jump 'n' run) or even jump into a fighter or bomber and attack the enemies islands and units (action-sim).",

This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.\n\nThere are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.\n\nThe game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.",

      "description": "<i>Spectre</i> is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.\n\nThere is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.\n\nEvery level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.\n\nWith every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.\n\nThe game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.\n\nAn additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: <ol><li><b>Arena</b> - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.</li><li><b>Flag Rally</b> - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.</li><li><b>Base Raid</b> - Akin to \"capture the flag\".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.</li></ol>The CD-ROM manual includes a \"Cyberpunk story\", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.",

      "description": "<i>Oids</i> may be described as a cross between the classic arcade games Gravitar and Choplifter, including a game editor for creating your own planetoids and galaxies.\n\nYou control a V-Wing fighter on many different planetoids to rescue and free a race of android slaves, the \"Oids\" of the game's title. The spacecraft controls are similar to a lunar-lander. Turn and thrust because gravity is always pulling at your ship. If your ship crashes into a mountain or any other obstruction on the ground, it will explode.\n\nTo survive against the various defenses on the planetoids (enemy spaceships, rockets and more) your ship is equipped with two different weapons and an energy shield. Flying around and using the energy shield costs fuel. You can refuel by landing next to a fuel base.\n\nThe main objective on each of your missions is to rescue all the Oids on each planetoid in the galaxy. To rescue the Oids, you must first destroy the factories in which they are held captive. Use only single shoots to avoid killing the Oids. Once you have blasted a factory open, the Oids will run out and wave to you. Find a flat surface nearby and land your ship. Once eight Oids have climbed aboard, or you have rescued all the Oids on the planetoid, it's time to dock with your mother-ship to complete your rescue mission.",

You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, <i>Dynamite Headdy</i> is just a traditional platformer at heart.",

To maneuver, players simply point their ship in the direction they want to go and thrust. Stopping is as simple as turning in the opposite direction and thereby thrusting against the ship's current direction.\n\nIn addition to the exploration inherent within the game, there are also a number of side-missions that can be picked up by the player at their leisure, as well as a handful of storyline missions.\n\n<em>EVN</em> is a very freeform game; players are not even required to peruse the story missions. They can focus on upgrading their ship, become a pirate, or establish a fleet in order to exploit profitable trade routes.\n\nWhen players engage a ship in combat, it will become \"Disabled\" shortly before it takes enough damage to be destroyed. Players then have the option of stopping their attack in order to board the ship in order to steal credits, resources, or even the entire ship itself (it can either replace the player's own ship or be added to their fleet). Naturally, ship captures are not always successful.",

Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.\n\nThe gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the \"Advanced system\" from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.",

      "description": "The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the \"Alien Busters\" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.\r\n\r\nWhen you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.\r\n\r\nWhen you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. \r\n\r\nYou can play <i>Alien Storm</i> by yourself, or with another person.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They must race against each other and complete obstacle courses. Races are set in futuristic versions of cities such as London and Tokyo.

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.\n\nAs either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.",

Different balloons are introduced during the game including candy balloons which gives the player 50 points for each piece of candy caught, paint-bucket balloons which change the player's color depending on the balloon, and question mark balloons which gives the player a power-up such as Fireman Pep.

The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork \u2013 hidden ladders are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players.  Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.",

You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.\r\n\r\nIn the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. \r\n\r\nIn the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.\r\n\r\nIf your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.\r\n",

      "description": "Your mission in this game is to get the five Varmintz, some sort of raccoons, to the safe place inside their dens. The five Varmintz are: Binki, Shady, Rubin, Bean, and Lulu.\r\n\r\nThe game offers 10 different worlds to play. Each world consists of 6 levels, one level per Varmint, and an additional bonus level. You need to complete one world in order to proceed to the next one.\r\n\r\nWhen you start a level, you are giving control over your Varmint, at the very southern part of the level. Your destination is the very northern part of the level, there are the five dens, where each of them must be filled with a Varmint. The level is filled with obstacles, and enemies. And since you don\u2019t have a weapon, all you can do is to avoid all the enemies in order to get to your destination. For this, the two Power-Ups in the game will help you. These are Freeze (will freeze all enemies, but also rafts for a few seconds) and Potion (will make you invisible, so the enemies can\u2019t catch you). \r\n\r\nThe enemies include animals, people, cars, and trains, sometimes they are normal, but sometimes they are crazy, like pigs with revolvers riding on horses. Furthermore you must avoid water, since you can\u2019t swim. But you can use tree logs and other things as a raft to cross them. If a chasm blocks your way, you can jump above clouds to do the same.\r\n\r\nOn your way to the dens, your mission is to collect Golden Eggz. One is worth 1000 points, and once you have collected 50 of them, you are granted an extra life. Sometimes there are Trash Cans in a level, which are worth 10 Golden Eggz. And in rare occasions there are Golden Varmintz Heads, which are worth one extra life. In addition, there is a Clock, which will give you extra time (5 sec) in the next bonus level. Clocks are cumulative, so you can collect much time for every 6th level.\r\n\r\nWhen you die in a level, you can start from a Checkpoint, you don\u2019t need to play the entire level a second time. But that does not mean, that you can\u2019t save the game when you leave it. Just not inside the game.",

Mungola\u2019s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes \u2013 the F-27 Platypus.\n\n<i>Platypus</i> is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There are 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies.\n\nThe PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.",

You play a blob of tar named Gish (yes, I said a blob of tar) who is on a journey to find his girlfriend, Brea - who is not another blob of tar, but rather a human.\n\nUsing the complex, realistic physics engine, Gish must stick to walls, slide through cracks, topple boxes, and solve many other strange physics puzzles while battling enemies. Even jumping is very physics-heavy; Gish has to bounce up and down to gain momentum for a jump. The game includes three modes: Story, which is standard linear platforming, Collection, a sort of time attack mode, and Vs., where two Gishes fight to the death.",
