      "description": "<i>SimCity 2000</i> is the successor to the city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.\n\nThis title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building \"light\" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.",

Each of the eight planes (six regular and two bonus) features four different weapons: two have unlimited ammo, air mines and the special weapon are restricted to respectively ten and two uses per round. Before every of the eight regular and four bonus missions the player can choose between one of four characters and his aircraft (the other ones become his wingmen).",

As Doshin you may wander the Island helping native worshippers by bringing them trees altering land, fending off disasters and repulsing marauding monsters. The more you help the larger you grow... However it's not easy always being so nice.\n\nWith the touch of a button you become the feared Jyashin! A red winged demon whose only wish is to destroy. Using fireballs and his great strength you'll level whole civilizations to feed of the islanders hate and grow larger. By no means is the object of the game just to grow, you know that the villagers must build 16 monuments in your honor... However you possess a knowledge, an almost instinctual one, that when this happens a horrible fate will meet the island. Will you chose to forever serve and torment the populace or will you help build the monuments that you know must be built?\n\nThe game allows you to do whatever you like within the limits of Doshin's abilities. Want to build a mountain, go for it. Want to be genocidal, the world is your oyster. After half an hour of gameplay the sun will set and Doshin will \"die\" for the night, and when you start the next day you will have shrunk to your starting size. The only goal is to influence the villagers to build monuments in your name, whether they build out of devotion or fear is up to you.",

The game will then take you to a screen where each of the 4 players can select an action before a turn starts. An action can be viewing the dates you have, finding out each girl's interests or selecting a destination and initiating the turn. By doing that you will be transported to a 3D depiction of the map where you will view random events for all 4 players. Events are usually triggered when you find a girl at the location that you visited the given time and from there you can talk with that girl and if your relationship experience with that girl is high you can give her gifts and ask her for dates. When all players' events are over the turn ends (1 day passes) and the same procedure is repeated until the girl's love meter is high enough for you to express your feelings for her.",

If you choose to do the latter you are vulnerable as the enemy is able to attack you and have your health depleted.",

      "description": "<i>SimCity 64</i> continues Nintendo's use of the general SimCity game with their own addition of more cartoonish and Nintendo related elements. The relationship between <i>SimCity 64</i> and the SNES version can be seen by the reappearance of the earlier game's green haired tutorialmonger <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/simcity/screenshots/gameShotId,277038/\">Doctor Wright</a> [Dr.\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8]. \n\nThe gameplay is similar to <i>SimCity</i>, where the player zones certain areas for commercial, residential or industrial use, and then builds the civic infrastructure to support their growth. The city will develop in accordance with the roads, power structures, police stations, etc. that the player builds. However, in a twist, the player can then shrink their nigh omniscient overhead perspective into a first-person, citizen-on-the-streets view. While in this perspective, other Sims can be interacted with. They will tell the player about their lives and neighborhoods. Sighting a gun toting criminal on the sidewalk is a good indicator that more police stations need to be constructed. These city dwellers are rendered as cartoon sprites.\n\nApart from the ability to walk the streets there is some additional city interactivity available in the first-person perspective.\n<ul><li> At airports, the player can now access a helicopter. The vehicles' horizontal movement is controlled via the control stick and vertical movement with the up and down c-buttons.</li>\n<li>In a hide-and-seek mini-game Dr. Wright assigns you a person to find on the streets of your city. A bar on the bottom of the screen shows if you are drawing near to the quested person.

The game has no set goal; instead, it is more of a The Sims type of game, in which the player can do what they want, when they want, without rules, goals or time limit.\n\nWhen the player first arrives, they will be given a house to live in. Unfortunately, they have no money, so they must pay off their home loan by earning \"bells\", the game's form of currency. Bells can be earned by performing various tasks for the other citizens of the town, catching and selling fish and insects, selling items, finding money in trees, and more. In addition to paying off the loan, money can be used to buy furniture and clothing. The player's home can see further expansions once the loan is paid.\n\nOne of the other main features of the game is the multitude of literally colorful characters that populate the town, all of whom are anthropomorphic animals; the player is the only human in sight. The town starts with a randomized selection of animal villagers, and more can move in and out as the game progresses. The player is able to talk to and befriend their animal neighbors.\n\nThe game uses an internal clock in the game pak to keep track of the date and time. Season changes and special holidays will occur in the town as time passes.",

The game plays as a raising simulator, with the player guiding Josette through the text driven game through yes or no questions in a branching but limited story line.
