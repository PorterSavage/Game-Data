      "description": "A sequel to Worms 2, <i>Worms Armageddon</i> expands upon its predecessor by enhancing a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WormNet. \n\nLike the previous <i>Worms</i> installments, the game is an artillery variant. The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.\n\nThe game includes an expansive editor that allows players to customize nearly every aspect of the game. Custom teams can be created, and players are able to edit their special weapons, grave markers, flags, victory fanfares, and voice sets, which can be imported into the game from outer sources. A random terrain generator and a terrain-import system are provided as well. The latter makes it possible to import into the game files in image formats, which the game converts into playable terrains.\n",

You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.",

The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. Players land on different squares, each space holding one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. \n\nThe mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. One challenge is loosely based on \"Simon Says\", another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. There are skill games, racing games, puzzle games, and other types.\n\nA good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board.",

This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the people of the Lord and free them from slavery forever.\n\n<i>Ogre Battle 64</i> is a semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle, and is the third game in the series. Like its predecessors, the game is a tactical RPG. The main character, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and the player must control how each group attacks or defends, and whether straightforward attacks or magic shall be used.\n\nDepending on the player's choices, there are branching levels, each with their own difficulty levels. The more battles the player faces and completes, the more experience each warrior in the team gathers.",

Four player games and a new two player mode are also available for play.\r\n\r\nIn Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins.  At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions.\r\n\r\nDuel mode allows play between just two people.  You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square.  Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game.\r\n\r\nStory mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.",

Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, but the main goal is the same: complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end. \n\nThe single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.",

Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come.\n\nThe N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game.\n\nIf the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood War expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.",

As Doshin you may wander the Island helping native worshippers by bringing them trees altering land, fending off disasters and repulsing marauding monsters. The more you help the larger you grow... However it's not easy always being so nice.\n\nWith the touch of a button you become the feared Jyashin! A red winged demon whose only wish is to destroy. Using fireballs and his great strength you'll level whole civilizations to feed of the islanders hate and grow larger. By no means is the object of the game just to grow, you know that the villagers must build 16 monuments in your honor... However you possess a knowledge, an almost instinctual one, that when this happens a horrible fate will meet the island. Will you chose to forever serve and torment the populace or will you help build the monuments that you know must be built?\n\nThe game allows you to do whatever you like within the limits of Doshin's abilities. Want to build a mountain, go for it. Want to be genocidal, the world is your oyster. After half an hour of gameplay the sun will set and Doshin will \"die\" for the night, and when you start the next day you will have shrunk to your starting size. The only goal is to influence the villagers to build monuments in your name, whether they build out of devotion or fear is up to you.",

Newly introduced are Six God Combination Godmars, Giant Robo and Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player is offered a choice out of four pairs of protagonists/rivals, which affects the plot and the stages played. With the different variations included, there are over 100 missions.\n\nDuring the stages, the player moves his units over a map, attacking enemies and using special abilities. When getting attacked, player units may defend, counter, or attempt to evade, resulting in no damage at all if successful. Destroyed enemies give experience and money for upgrading between the missions. Often, scripted events happen, such as reinforcements arriving. Sometimes it's also possible to persuade certain characters to join the player's side, in addition to those that join automatically. Certain, otherwise unobtainable units, can also be unlocked by using the N64 Transfer Pak in combination with the Gameboy Color game <i>Super Robot Wars: Link Battler</i>.",

After choosing one of the playing boards, the players throw their dices in turns. Then the player moves forward on the board by a distance depending on the result of the dice throw. Each field represents a business or lot which can be bought if the player has enough money at hand. If another player lands on the same field, a rent has to be payed up. This all influences the stock value of the player's company.",

In each, various rule options can be set, including popular house rules like the free parking pot, double money for landing on GO and having to go around once before starting buying, while standard rules like the even build rule, the auctioning of unsold properties and rent immunity in trading can be switched off. Players can be set between two and four, with the computer filling out any number of positions. The personality of the computer opponents can be set in four levels, from cautious to intelligent. Eleven tokens are available, including the money bag, introduced to the game in 1998 by popular vote.\n\nGameplay is seen in 3D, with an animated roll of the dice, the tokens moving around the board (the walking animations can be turned off), and Mr. Monopoly holding up Chance and Community cards. The camera can be set to five different positions during token movement, and there is a free camera mode for inspecting assets. The game can be saved between turns.",
