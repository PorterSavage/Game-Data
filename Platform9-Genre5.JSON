      "description": "After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one of the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.\n\nGraphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.\n\nAs graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves J\u00e1gr, Fedorov and Sel\u00e4nne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a \"Brett Hull\". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.\n\nThe season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.\n\nLike in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.",

Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China.\n\nIt's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the <i>Classics</i> matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available.",

Oh, and Jordan's back. \n\nLike its predecessors in the long-running  series, <i>NBA Live 2000</i> strives for realistic basketball simulation rather than arcade-like gameplay. New moves have been added in this installments, and opponent AI has been tweaked to make victory more dependent on executing the right moves at the right times. As in the previous <i>NBA Live</i> games, it is possible to edit and create basketball players, as well as create and build an own team. This time, it is also possible to use any picture to serve as a player photo.\n\nNew to this installment (beside Jordan) is a one-on-one street basketball mode, and a mode that allows management of a team for several seasons, including trading players.",

      "description": "The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.\n\nTelemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks. ",

Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. \n\n<i>Mario Golf 64</i> features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special \"Time Attack Mode,\" where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. \n\nMario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional \"Club Handicap Mode\" ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.",

Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.\n\nGame modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well. Players can customize their racers, modifying their parameters, which include grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability.",

      "description": "<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around 3D environments.  Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.\n\nThe game is divided into two types of levels.  In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse.  In each of these areas, there are 5 goals to complete.  Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape.  By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible.  If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal.  There are 3 levels like this.\n\nThere are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself.  Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.",

      "description": "WCW/NWO Revenge puts the power of the biggest, baddest and meanest wrestlers around the world in the hands of the player. There are more than 60 real and fictional wrestlers - including then-superstars Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Raven and Goldberg - to choose from to square off in the ring in any of several modes of play. \n\nEach wrestler has an extensive list of moves they are able to perform, although certain physical attributes can affect the availability of certain actions - such as a heavyweight not being able to perform a moonsault from the top ropes, or a cruiserweight not being able to power bomb a larger opponent. The engine is based upon a B-button strike and A-button grapple system. Holding the respective button results in a 'heavy' strike or grapple. Finishing off an opponent generally involves performing your wrestler's special move on them, which can be executed with the flick of the control stick once the wrestler has filled his Spirit Meter, and will be followed with a TV-style instant replay. Depending on the match settings set beforehand, a player can find hidden weapons from the crowd, be assisted or double-teamed by a run-in interference or make his opponent tap out with a submission hold.\n\nThere are several match types and game modes, all of which can take place in a number of arenas designed after the current WCW pay-per-view events of the time. New to the series is a 40-man battle royal, allowing for 4 players or computer-controlled wrestlers to square off in the ring at a time until one is pinned or submitted; at which point they are replaced by a new entrant, continuing on and on until up to 40 wrestlers have entered. The main focus of single-player wrestling revolved around the championship mode, in which a player chooses a wrestler and a championship belt to compete for - beginning with the TV Title on up to the WCW World Championship. After defeating a successive series of opponents, the player then goes toe-to-toe with the current holder of the belt for possession of the championship; upon victory a new wrestler and new championship is unlocked. 1-4 player exhibition matches can be set to play out with an assortment of various settings and rules - such as 2 vs. 1 handicaps, no-disqualifications and tag team battles.\n\nThe game automatically tracks and saves to the battery the stats and arcade-style scores accrued across the various game modes. Also available to the player is a costume editing feature, allowing for quick color changes to full-on wardrobe conversions for each wrestler.\n\nRevenge was a refinement of the engine seminal wrestling house AKI developed for WCW/NWO World Tour. It would be their final WCW game, as the developer moved on and converted their engine to the WWF license with their next release.",

      "description": "<i>WWF War Zone</i> is the first WWF-based wrestling game to use fully 3D character and environment graphics. The wrestlers can execute traditional punch and kicks, as well as various grapple moves, which the player can perform by pressing a button assigned to initial grapple in a combination with different direction buttons. Commentary, wrestler introductions (with short voice clips), crowd reactions, and full-motion sequences (in the PlayStation version only) are included.\n\nThe game features seven basic gameplay modes, allowing configurations of one to four players. These include training mode, one-on-one, tag team, cage match, weapons match, tornado tag team, and war (elimination free for all). Two additional modes, Royal Rumble and gauntlet, are exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version. The player can also create and customize his own wrestler, taking him through the WWF challenge. The new wrestler finds himself at the bottom of a pyramid, and has to challenge wrestlers situated immediately above him, gradually working his way through to the title. Sometimes previously defeated wrestlers will challenge the player to a \"grudge match\", which usually consists of special encounters, such as battles with weapons or cage matches. \n\n",

The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, including a variety of game modes and specialty matches, such as Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, Tornado matches, and others. The Create-A-Wrestler mode has been slightly enhanced, adding commentary and crowd chants responding to the superstars' nicknames. The Challenge Mode of the previous game is replaced by the Career Mode, allowing the player-controlled wrestler to participate in house shows, winning matches to work his way up to the prestigious Raw show, pay-per-view events, and eventually compete for the title. A few new match types and fall superstar entrances have also been added. \n\nNew game modes include Create-A-Stable and a Pay-Per-View mode, which allows the player to set up an own wrestling event. The game includes an option to customize arenas, editing the color of lights, ropes, turnbuckles, logos etc.",

      "description": "The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.\r\nNew sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.\r\n\r\nMuch like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.\r\n\r\nYou can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.",

Among the new features, it is now possible to make more than one player bid at the same time, more frequent and detailed staff messages, player history to track down previous seasons, a full 3D match engine and a 2D radar view (replacing the old text mode) and finally merchandising and catering, and individual adboard management. The detailed database is still there, and so are the Manager and Pro-Manager modes. Only the English leagues are playable still and Kevin Keegan, Fulham and then soon-to-be England manager, endorsed the title.\n\nThe manager modes and options remain the same: Manager allows the player to start in any team, Pro-Manager requires building a career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. The difficulty level can be further tweaked by changing areas where the staff takes control, and you can determine if players age and retire with time.\n\nAgain, up to 20 players can play in Manager mode and 8 in Pro-Manager.",

It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. \n\nPlayer can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. \n\nWinning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.",

Being a snowboarding game, each track is a downhill slalom with a ski lift at the bottom which takes you back to the start for however many laps a track has.\n\nThe tracks are varied, the first few taking place on snowy mountainsides, while the latter taking you to wackier locales such as grassy countryside, a desert and a theme park. The money collected on the course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so.\n\nOther modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There are also unlockables for dedicated players.",

You can win special prices for getting enough points.\n\nAdditionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions: your tennis field might be rotating, made of ice or be about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choice from your opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose the item that your opponent picks. Keep on losing and you will have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.",

      "description": "<i>Air Boarder 64</i> is a game that resembles skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater but with a certain aspect of it being quite different. Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hover boards.\n\nThe single-player option features the following modes:\n<ul><li>Lecture: the mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses.</li><br>\n<li>Street Work: the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters (others become available later), 5 stages and 4 boards (with more available later) from which you can choose. In each stage you are given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the timer resets back and, if you pass through all them, the game ends regardless of how much time is left. When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage).</li><br>\n<li>Time Attack: you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the littlest time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen in a map that appears onscreen.</li><br>\n<li>Coin: mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered in the stage within the time limit.</li><br>\n<li>Free Run: this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a means of getting you acquainted with stages.</li></ul>\nTwo-players option features the following modes:\n<ul><li>Vs. Race: a race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles in the order that is specified wins.</li><br>\n<li>Vs. Coin: a mode where the player who gets all the coins or has more of them when the time ends wins.</li></ul>",

As in the original sport, goal of the relatively short matches (measured in seconds) is to push the opponent out of the fighting area. The game uses 3D areas, the analogue stick for movement and C-button combinations to perform moves. Besides exhibition matches and various tournaments there also is a career mode which features decisions and minigames between matches, which influence the sumo wrestler's statistics, for example choosing the diet or fishing. The game uses a comic look and some of the eight areas feature unusual places such as the Moon or Egypt. ",

It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungs\u00e4ngen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.\n\nParticipation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings. ",

      "description": "<i>Madden NFL 2001</i> is another yearly update in the long-running football series. The version for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 comes with its own selection of teams, modes and options, refined from the previous year's iteration. Compared to other versions, it has the largest number of modes, but less graphical fidelity and a lower number of selectable teams.\n\nPlayers can select from the 31 teams of the 2000 NFL season and the 1999 All-Madden team on both consoles. The PlayStation version adds 31 All-Time franchise teams and 101 Classic NFL teams, from 1960 to 1999. Available modes include exhibition games, season, franchise, custom league (four to eight players), tournament (for 4, 8 or 16 players in single or double elimination), practice, and situation (set up any possible game situation to play). A new addition is called Two-Minute Drill: up to ten players compete for points by trying to perform spectacular plays within a two-minute time limit. Exclusive to the PlayStation version is the Great Games mode, allowing players to relive classic matchups from NFL history. The Great Games must be taken on in order and winning one makes the involved teams available for selection in other modes. As usual, player creation, drafting and trading as well as custom play creation is included in the game as well.\n\nThe previous year's Madden Challenge reappears in a new form called Madden Cards, resembling a collectible card game. The game includes a list of 100 challenges organized in five different levels. These include making certain plays or play combinations, beating teams under certain conditions (e.g. at home and in the rain), avoiding fumbles, sacks and penalties, et cetera. Completing a challenge gains the player tokens (how many depends on the difficulty level played at) which can be spent to buy a number of randomized Madden Cards. There are a total of 296 cards in the game (differing in rarity) which are collected in the in-game card book. Unwanted cards can be sold to regain half the tokens paid. It is also possible to trade cards with other player profiles and it is even possible to wager cards in two-player games. The cards have a number of different effects: most unlock classic players as well as hidden teams and stadiums. Others can be activated for different gameplay effects: making the game harder or easier or enabling gags such as teleporting players or putting the camera inside the ball.",

      "description": "<i>Madden NFL 2002</i> is another yearly update in the long-running football franchise. With main series developer Tiburon focusing their efforts on the new generation of consoles, it fell to developer Budcat to update the game for the new year on the veteran platforms PlayStation and Nintendo 64. The 2002 version is closely based on the previous year's game, with almost the same menus and many of the same modes and options, but also several new features, including a redesigned kick meter and mulligans, allowing one to take back and replay a limited number of plays per game.\n\nThe included teams have been updated for the 2001 NFL season and include the 31 regular teams plus the 2002 expansion team, the Houston Texans, NFC and AFC all-star teams and two All-Madden teams (2000 and Super Bowl). Exclusive to the PlayStation version are more than 90 classic NFL teams, 31 all-time franchise teams and the 6 NFL Europe teams.\n\nThe returning modes include Exhibition, Season, Franchise, Custom League, Tournament, Situation (Great Games is again only featured on PlayStation), and Two-Minute Drill (with an added Head-to-Head option, facing off two players with one playing offense and the other defense). The Practice mode has been expanded to the Coaches Corner mode: the team practice option is the same as the previous year's practice while the new training mode is a tutorial that guides players through various plays by explaining when to use and how best to perform them. A special mode exclusive to this version of the game is called Madden Classic. It is a fully featured game-within-a-game that goes back to the early days of the series: regarding visuals, options, and menus, it is based on Madden 92 for Genesis, but features the teams and rosters of the current season.\n\nThe Madden Cards feature returns from the previous game. Tokens to buy cards can be won by completing a number of challenges or through the training mode. The card roster has been expanded from the previous year and now includes cheerleader cards that hype up their team when used.",
