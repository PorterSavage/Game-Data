      "description": "For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! \n\n<i>Re-Volt</i> is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a \"reversed\" (backwards) or \"mirror\" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. \n\nThere are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. \n\nIn Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.\n\nTelemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks. ",

      "description": "<i>Mario Kart 64</i> races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. \n\nThe game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups. ",

The goal is to beat the other participants in the race by successfully navigating the jet-ski through courses marked by colored buoys. Red and yellow buoys must be passed on right and left side, respectively, in order to gain speed and ensure advantage in the race. Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.\n\nGame modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well. Players can customize their racers, modifying their parameters, which include grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability.",

      "description": "It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island!  After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return.  Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.\n\n<i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons.  However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, <b>many</b> hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\".  In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).\n\nThe game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times).  This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.\n\nUp to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game.  There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).",

A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.\n\n<em>Blast Corps</em> is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits to trucks or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes it's not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it will!\n\n<em>Blast Corps</em> features secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once it has been completed to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDUs (Radiation Dispersal Units), which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them, as well as destroy all of the buildings, rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...",

      "description": "Famed SNES racer F-Zero gets a 64-bit update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.\n\nWhile the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a l\u00e1 Mario Kart 64.\n\nGone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the \"X\" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.\n\nOne of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.\n\n",

      "description": "The game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by five hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the country to its knees. When gas prices went wild, six civilians who called themselves Vigilantes, led by the truck driver Convoy, began fighting against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.\n\n<i>Vigilante 8</i> is a vehicular combat game similar to Twisted Metal in concept. Players can choose from eight characters with different agendas, and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer is also included: the PlayStation version allows two players (four in the Nintendo 64 version) to go head-to-head.",

      "description": "The year is 2016. Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\n\n<i>Body Harvest</i> is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.\n\nEach vehicle has its own speed, armor, and fuel capacity attributes. Controllable vehicles range from armored cars and tanks to boats, helicopters, planes, and even a space ship during a few missions. Buildings scattered around levels may contain useful items, ammunition, and fuel. The player has to avoid killing innocent people; too many casualties result in a premature end of the game. Typically, the main goals in each area are to destroy the alien Shield Generator, defeat a boss enemy, and proceed to the next stage.",

The outrageous jumps and precision timing required in the original have been translated into a modern 3D racing game.\n\nThere are several game modes to choose from. First, there is a season mode with multiple skill levels. Completing a 5-race season in first place unlocks special tracks and more difficult classes. Second, there is a exhibition mode which allows you and up to 3 other people to choose a single track to race on. Third, there is a time trial mode in which you try to get the best times on the 20 tracks.\n\nFinally, there are multiple special tracks. Some of the special tracks include a point-to-point race through the desert, a hill-climb competition, motocross soccer, and a pixel-perfect conversion of the original <i>Excitebike</i>. <i>Excitebike 64</i> also includes a track editor for building your own competitions.",

Game mechanics follow arcade rules, with turbos to accelerate to (and raise) maximum speed, and any deviation off of the track bumping you right back on it.\n\nCars range from sportcars to more esoteric vehicles such as trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model real localities (Alaska, India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, Amazon, Mars).",

Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.\r\nNew sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.\r\n\r\nMuch like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.\r\n\r\nYou can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.",

That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly.\r\n\r\nA 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.

You have the chance to set up the car to perfect the handling for each of the 17 diverse circuits. Wet racing is incorporated, with gradual weather chances, as well as tyre wear requiring pitstops.\n\nIn total there are five distinct gameplay modes. A solo player can play through the entire championship, with practice and qualifying as well as the race against 21 other cars. A Challenge mode including key situations allows you to try to alter the course of history. There is also a 2-player head-to-head mode, Time Attack and one-off races of any length.",

      "description": "The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar!  All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van.  Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States.  The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks.  Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.\n\n<i>Mickey's Speedway USA</i> is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine.  Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy.  There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them.  Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.\n\nThe game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few.  There are also 'Oomph Tokens' scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer's maximum speed a little.\n\nAs well as the main game, Mickey's Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 - players must pop their opponents' three balloons before they lose all of their own).  The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey's Speedway USA.",

      "description": "The sequel to the famous snowboard simulation Snowboard Kids is a fun family sports game. It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. \n\nPlayer can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. \n\nWinning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.",

Individual settings that can be modified for the cars are: Tire, Brake, Suspension, Steering, Transmission, Gear and Aerodynamics.\n\nNone of the eight cars in the game are licensed or real models but they do seem very similar to actual models.\n\nAlmost all of the option and game screens are in English.\n\nThe course variety is pretty varied.  There are three separate tracks with some minor route variations in each.  Each course has  2-4 alternate segments that are turned on and off similar to Ridge Racer.\n\nThe graphics have some variety as well.  The courses are: Sea Side (Easy), Mountain (Normal), and Down Town (Hard).  The look and handling of each changes as well with weather variations such as rain and snow.",

The money collected on the course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so.\n\nOther modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There are also unlockables for dedicated players.",

The game also supports up to four human players. \n\nIn <i>Race Series</i> you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the option to customize your car\u2019s parts \u2013 parts like the car\u2019s body, engine, tires, etc. \u2013 but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players.\n\n<i>Time Trial</i> is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against.\n\n<i>VS Race</i> mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles. \n\n<i>New Track</i> lets you create your own custom made track.
