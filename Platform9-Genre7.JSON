      "description": "Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last.\n\n<i>Forsaken</i> is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. \n\nOn the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.",

      "description": "An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.\n\nid Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, <i>Quake</i> is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.\n\nIn single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.\n\nUnlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.\n\nThe enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.\n\n<i>Quake</i> was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.",

One day he learns that Kage Mishima, a sworn enemy of his clan, has gained possession of the Daikatana, a magical sword that allows its bearer to travel through time. As a result of Mishima's quest for power, a devastating disease is threatening humanity. Hiro and his friends must venture into different time periods, retrieve the sword, and defeat Mishima. \n\n<i>Daikatana</i> is a first-person shooter using the Quake II engine. The game is divided into four episodes of several levels each, each episode taking place in a different time period: far-future Japan, ancient Greece, Dark Ages Norway, and near-future USA. The game uses cutscenes and text to tell the story. Two AI-controlled characters accompany Hiro throughout the quest, helping him in battles and also requiring protection. In addition to several different firearms, the Daikatana itself, which the player acquires in Episode 2, can gain experience and grow stronger as it is used. The game includes a multi-player deathmatch mode.",

      "description": "<i>Hexen</i> is the sequel to Heretic.  While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.\n\nLike <i>Heretic</i>, <i>Hexen</i> is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of <i>Heretic</i>'s innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.\n\nThe hub system steps away from the traditional \"single levels stringed along into episodes\" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In <i>Hexen</i>'s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single \"hub\" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the \"spoke\" levels. Many of the puzzles in <i>Hexen</i> require travel back and forth between different levels.\n\nOther innovations in <i>Hexen</i> include weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases. The game also includes scripted sequences created with a language called ACS, allowing for much more complex puzzles and dramatic scenes. ",

      "description": "The Earth is separated by an invisible barrier from the Lost Land, a realm in which time has no meaning, and which is inhabited by ferocious dinosaurs and aliens. For many generations, the mantle of Turok has been bestowed upon those who saw the protection of the barrier as their sacred duty. But an evil lord named Campaigner is seeking for an artifact that is capable of destroying the barrier, striving to dominate the entire universe. This artifact, known as the Chronoscepter, was broken into pieces which were then hidden away. Tal'Set, a Native American and the last Turok, must find the scattered pieces of the Chronoscepter, and stop the Campaigner from obtaining them.\n\n<i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> is a first-person shooter with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements. Much of the game is set in outdoor environments, and requires the player to explore them by finding various paths, jumping, swimming, and climbing. The game's most notable enemies are dinosaurs of various sizes, though the levels also include human and demonic enemies, as well as wildlife. The player gradually gains access to thirteen weapons (plus the Chronoscepter, assembling which is the game's main objective); these include a knife, a bow, as well as high-tech firearms such as a rocket launcher and an atomic fusion cannon.

      "description": "<i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> is the sequel to Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nHaving defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world.\n\nThe game features an armory twice as large as its predecessor, and many weapons will even have a later update that makes them even more devastating. New weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying grenade that homes in on an enemy's head, drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have damage models now, allowing limbs to be torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won't be facing any human opponents this time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human hybrids, brutish giants, and man-sized insectoids.\n\nThe goal of each level is to reach the end and defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock the portals that lead to later levels. In each level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as immunity to lava or a long jump. After finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use that power to find one of the five keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for spiritual powers Turok will occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly creatures who appear to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose is the job for another Turok.\n\nA multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and game-types like deathmatch and capture-the-flag. This multiplayer mode would later be expanded into a full game with Turok: Rage Wars.",

The cars are based on the attributes of extinct Terran animals. Race nine different cars (some need to be unlocked) on nine different tracks. You can race, or you can shoot your opponents with the nine different weapons. Plenty of multiplayer options (including split screen on PC).",

      "description": "A comet is heading toward South Park, causing many of the enemies from early seasons of the shows (including cows, aliens, and clones) to rise up and attack.  The player takes control of Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan to fight through the town in a first-person perspective.  Features new dialogue from the original voice actors on the show.\n\nSingle player takes the form of a \"Story\" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels.  The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight.  Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls.  Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this.  The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps.  The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.\n\nA multiplayer mode lets players take characters and weapons they unlock in Story mode into small deathmatch arenas. The PlayStation version supports 2 players, the N64 does 4, and the PC version allows players to go online to search for opponents through GameSpy.  Players can set standard victory options like knockouts or time limits.  Voice samples for multiplayer are also included, so the characters will make comments and taunts when hit.\n\nGraphics are rendered in 3D, in a style approximating that of the show.  Draw distance is limited by a heavy fog, with varying severity based on the platform.  None of the environments are interactive, and only enemies respond to weapon hits.  The N64 version supports the Expansion Pak.",

      "description": "The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming's novels returns in this first-person shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.\n\nTen years later, a mysterious organization named \"Janus\" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called \"GoldenEye\", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.\n\nIn this 3D action game the player controls James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate his foes. However, many parts require the player to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to his presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in most of them Bond will have to perform other tasks besides killing his enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels. Higher difficulty means, besides having to deal with tougher enemies, additional objectives needed to be fulfilled in order to successfully complete the level.",

Every once in a while, you will also use the Blue Marine submarine and the Landmaster tank.\n\nThe 15 levels range from forward scrolling levels (much like <a href=\"/game/panzer-dragoon\">Panzer Dragoon</a> or some elements of Star Wars Arcade) to full 3D arenas, each with a certain goal to achieve or boss to destroy. The bigger your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, which is split into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the final level.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main characters run around with laser cannons.",

      "description": "After having fulfilled Princess Zelda's request and saved the land of Hyrule from a grave danger, Link departs on his horse Epona. In the Lost Woods he is ambushed by Skull Kid, an imp who dons a mysterious mask, accompanied by the fairies Tael and Tatl. Skull Kid turns Link into a small plant-like creature known as Deku Scrub and takes away his horse and his magical ocarina. Shortly afterwards Tatl joins Link and agrees to help him revert to his native form. A meeting with a wandering mask salesman reveals that the Skull Kid is wearing Majora's Mask, an ancient item used in hexing rituals, which calls forth a menacing moon hovering over the land of Termina. Link has exactly three days to find a way to prevent this from happening.\n\n<i>Majora's Mask</i> is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time. It utilizes the same engine and visual style, and virtually identical interface. The game retains the traditional elements of Zelda games (dungeon exploration, sword fighting, bows, bombs, heart containers, etc.) as well as those introduced in its immediate predecessor, such as active blocking with a shield, various throwing items, and the usage of melodies played on the ocarina to solve puzzles. Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games.\n\nAlso unique to this entry is its time system. The game has an internal clock, with one hour roughly corresponding to one real-life minute. If the player hasn't completed all the objectives within three in-game days, the moon falls on Termina, annihilating everyone and ending the game. However, the player can return to the first day at any time by playing a song on the ocarina, saving all quest-related progress and inventory but losing other items such as ammunition or money (unless stored in a bank). It is also possible to learn melodies that slow the time passage significantly, or advance the clock instantly to the next day. Some events happen only at specific times, and many characters follow their own schedules throughout the three days. Owl statues scattered across the land provide quick-save points and serve as teleporters between areas when discovered.\n\nCollection and usage of masks play an important role in the game. Most of the twenty-four masks that can be found in the game are optional, and usually serve to solve side quests or enhance Link's abilities, allowing him, for example, to run faster or to become invisible. Transformation masks can be used to turn Link into a Deku Scrub, a Goron, or a Zora. Each of these forms has access to unique abilities, many of which are essential to the completion of the game. Among other skills, Deku Link can shoot bubbles from his mouth and float between flowers; Goron Link can operate heavy switches and walk through  lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim fast and generate force fields.",

      "description": "It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island!  After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return.  Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.\n\n<i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons.  However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, <b>many</b> hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\".  In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).\n\nThe game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times).  This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.\n\nUp to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game.  There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).",

Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.\r\n\r\nPresentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).\r\n\r\nHowever, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.\r\n\r\nA 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.",

      "description": "When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed in Turok 2: Seeds of Evil the resulting explosion created a shockwave throughout the universe. This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. \n\nThe third title in the <i>Turok</i> series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors.

Both game and film follow Bond's investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon's new pipeline, while the game introduces new areas and a backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and gunplay, with each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission briefing.\n\nIn contrast to the PlayStation title of the same name, this version is structured more like a successor to Rare's GoldenEye 007. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each mission. An \"awards\" system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes for beating target times for single-player levels.\n\nThe game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.",

      "description": "Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world.  Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters.\n\n<i>Perfect Dark</i> is a 3D first-person shooter similar to Rare's earlier GoldenEye 007, though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, various explosives, and others.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. Most weapons have secondary fire modes and reloading them is displayed in an on-screen animation. \n\nShields are scattered through the stages and can be picked up for additional protection. There are no health-restoring items and Joanna cannot jump. Like <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, the game has three difficulty levels, with the higher ones featuring more accurate enemies, less ammo, and more objectives for the player to complete within each mission. Cutscenes with voice acting advance the story between missions.\n\nThe game also features a training mode set in the Carrington Institute. Completing the firing range challenge there unlocks the classic weapons from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.  In addition, the campaign can be played in a co-operative mode for two human players or one human player and up to three computer-controlled teammates (in split-screen mode), as well as in a \"Counter Operative\" mode, where one of the players takes control of an enemy and tries to stop Joanna from fulfilling her mission. \n\nMultiplayer includes a variety of modes. Among those are the traditional deathmatch as well as the objective-based Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. Other scenarios and objectives include surviving as long as possible while carrying a briefcase, hacking computer systems with randomly placed data uplinks, and hunting down a single player as a team. Stages, teams, and weapon placement can be customized by players.\n\nThe Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.",

      "description": "As Todd Snap, an aspiring Pok\u00e9mon photographer, you must travel through different environment types in order to photograph as many Pok\u00e9mon as you can find. With the help of Professor Oak, you will discover new places to photograph Pok\u00e9mon, ranging from those such as a volcano which houses Fire Pok\u00e9mon to a jungle housing Grass Pok\u00e9mon. The game features 63 of the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon, including favorites such as Pikachu and Charizard.\n\nThroughout your journey as a Pok\u00e9mon photographer you will obtain new items from Professor Oak to help snap a photo of those Pok\u00e9mon whose attention you just can't seem to attract. At first you are equipped with only an apple, but by taking great photos of various species you will get access to items such as a Pester Ball or a Pok\u00e9 Flute. Gameplay is similar to that of a rail-shooter, in which you move across a linear route and are only able to look around to take pictures. At the end of each route you receive a score from Oak depending on things such as the position of the Pok\u00e9mon in the frame shot, the size of the Pok\u00e9mon in the picture, or how many of that Pok\u00e9mon are together in the shot. Up to 60 photos can be taken during each course and you choose the one to submit to Oak. All the photos you take can later be accessed in your own Pok\u00e9mon album. The game features six different courses, but a seventh one can be unlocked by taking a picture of a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon sign in each of the other courses. The seventh course known as Rainbow Cloud offers the only opportunity to snap a photo of  the rare and elusive psychic Pok\u00e9mon, Mew.\n\nWhen released for Virtual Console on the Wii, a couple changes were made to the game. First, Jynx's skin color was changed from black to purple to match its current design and avoid the controversy its original design had caused due to its resemblance of the blackface caricature. Second, in order to mimic the functionality of the Pok\u00e9mon Snap Stations found in stores that let players bring in their cartridges and print their pictures, a feature was added that let players upload one picture each day to the Wii Message Board to share with people on their friend list.",

After tearing through space, hell, and wherever else in the previous games, the  Space Marine thought that the threat of the demons was finally past. Of course, one survived, and it is currently reanimating all of the fallen monsters in a last-ditch attempt to revitalize their evil mission. The player's task is to finally rid the universe of all the crazy hellions, from the dead guy with the pistol to the rocket-spewing Cyberdemon.\n\nThe game is very different from the original DOOM; it has larger sprites, pseudo 3D, new textures, scrolling skies, custom scripting which allows for morphing environments, spawning items and new character animations. The levels are completely new and the game features the Unmaker weapon and an alternative end boss.",

An arcade mode in which you fight ever increasingly difficult waves of enemies. A story mode, in which you are simply a pilot, where you are told exactly what your orders are. A strategy mode, in which you can build units and send them off to do battle for you.\n\nIn addition to containing all the missions available in the PC version of this game, there are also additional missions that continue the story where the PC game left off.",

At this point it purely raced on oval tracks, and featuring Indianapolis-style race cars - open wheel, open cockpit.\n\nAll 20 drivers and their cars and teams are authentic with fully licensed IRL tracks including night time tracks at Texas and Charlotte. Two player mode is supported and there is a unique draft meter to aid in making sling-shot moves for passing.\n\nTop drivers are represented with detailed replicas of their cars. It is a racing simulation rather than a pure action game, letting you choose the angles of the front wing, rear wing, set the tire pressure, gear ratios and transmission type.",

You have the chance to set up the car to perfect the handling for each of the 17 diverse circuits. Wet racing is incorporated, with gradual weather chances, as well as tyre wear requiring pitstops.\n\nIn total there are five distinct gameplay modes. A solo player can play through the entire championship, with practice and qualifying as well as the race against 21 other cars. A Challenge mode including key situations allows you to try to alter the course of history. There is also a 2-player head-to-head mode, Time Attack and one-off races of any length.",

As Doshin you may wander the Island helping native worshippers by bringing them trees altering land, fending off disasters and repulsing marauding monsters. The more you help the larger you grow... However it's not easy always being so nice.\n\nWith the touch of a button you become the feared Jyashin! A red winged demon whose only wish is to destroy. Using fireballs and his great strength you'll level whole civilizations to feed of the islanders hate and grow larger. By no means is the object of the game just to grow, you know that the villagers must build 16 monuments in your honor... However you possess a knowledge, an almost instinctual one, that when this happens a horrible fate will meet the island. Will you chose to forever serve and torment the populace or will you help build the monuments that you know must be built?\n\nThe game allows you to do whatever you like within the limits of Doshin's abilities. Want to build a mountain, go for it. Want to be genocidal, the world is your oyster. After half an hour of gameplay the sun will set and Doshin will \"die\" for the night, and when you start the next day you will have shrunk to your starting size. The only goal is to influence the villagers to build monuments in your name, whether they build out of devotion or fear is up to you.",

The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Roadster Trophy</b> \u2013 The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate;  the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in  possession.\n\n<li><b>Multi-Player</b> \u2013 Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen. \n\n<li><b>Quick Race</b> \u2013 In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players.\n\n<li><b>Time Trial</b> \u2013 Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</li></ul>\n",

      "description": "<i>SimCity 64</i> continues Nintendo's use of the general SimCity game with their own addition of more cartoonish and Nintendo related elements. The relationship between <i>SimCity 64</i> and the SNES version can be seen by the reappearance of the earlier game's green haired tutorialmonger <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/simcity/screenshots/gameShotId,277038/\">Doctor Wright</a> [Dr.\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8]. \n\nThe gameplay is similar to <i>SimCity</i>, where the player zones certain areas for commercial, residential or industrial use, and then builds the civic infrastructure to support their growth. The city will develop in accordance with the roads, power structures, police stations, etc. that the player builds. However, in a twist, the player can then shrink their nigh omniscient overhead perspective into a first-person, citizen-on-the-streets view. While in this perspective, other Sims can be interacted with. They will tell the player about their lives and neighborhoods. Sighting a gun toting criminal on the sidewalk is a good indicator that more police stations need to be constructed. These city dwellers are rendered as cartoon sprites.\n\nApart from the ability to walk the streets there is some additional city interactivity available in the first-person perspective.\n<ul><li> At airports, the player can now access a helicopter. The vehicles' horizontal movement is controlled via the control stick and vertical movement with the up and down c-buttons.</li>\n<li>In a hide-and-seek mini-game Dr. Wright assigns you a person to find on the streets of your city. A bar on the bottom of the screen shows if you are drawing near to the quested person. There are some rewards to be had from listening to these persons' stories.</li>\n<li>If a rail system is in play players can board it; it can also be ridden, and the player may look out of the window of their car.</li></ul>\nUsing Mario Artist: Paint Studio players can create a character, animated with two frames of animation, and import him or her into <i>SimCity 64</i>. This character can roam the streets until the player decides to make a new one.",

The player can paint on a canvas using a variety of colors and tools. Stamps can also be added in the form of official artwork from various Nintendo games. Images can also be imported from video tapes and the Game Boy Camera. Another feature is the exploration of three 3D worlds, and taking pictures of their sights with a virtual camera in the vein of Pok\u00e9mon Snap. Also included are minigames, including Fly Swatting, based on <i>Mario Paint's</i> Gnat World.",

      "description": "<i>Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue</i> is one of several different games based on the 2000 incarnation of the franchise. This time, the Power Rangers are recruited to protect the city of Mariner Bay against the evil Diabolico and his minions.\n\nThe game's main story mode is called Titanium Quest and consists of three episodes that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of a number of missions, for over 30 missions in total. The missions are of one of four different types.\n\nThe Ranger levels are seen from an angled top-down perspective. A pre-determined Ranger is tasked with either rescuing a number of innocents or removing dangerous obstacles within a time limit. A radar map shows the way to the next objective. Enemy goons that stand in the way can be taken out by shooting an energy burst. Power-ups can be collected that enable more powerful shots, short-time invisibility or enhanced armor, health upgrades and more. Occasionally, the Ranger levels feature boss fights against more powerful enemies.\n\nThe driving levels are seen from the side. A Ranger-controlled vehicle drives from left to right and must put out fires, rescue civilians or clean up radioactive spills while avoiding traffic and shooting at enemy vehicles. There is a time limit and power-ups can be collected to restore health lost through attacks or crashes.\n\nThe Megazord levels are one-on-one battles that pit the Ranger's Megazord mech against one powerful boss enemy. Perspective can be switched between first- and third-person. The goal is to destroy the enemy with missiles or, if close enough, with melee attacks. Blocking is possible and power-ups can be picked up to restore health or increase firepower.\n\nThe final type of level are flying levels in which players control the Green Ranger's hovercraft. In these, the goal is once more to rescue innocents or alternatively, collect a number of items. The hovercraft is seen from behind and can freely move through a 3D environment. As in the Ranger levels, there is a radar map that shows the way to the next objective and a time limit.\n\nA two-player mode is also available, which consists of a split-screen variant of the Megazord battles. Characters to use in this mode must be unlocked by progressing in the single-player game.\n\nComic-style illustrations advance the storyline between levels.",
