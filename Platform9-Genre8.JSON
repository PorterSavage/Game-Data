      "description": "Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last.\n\n<i>Forsaken</i> is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. \n\nOn the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.",

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!\n\nSpace Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.\n\nYou can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.",

One day he learns that Kage Mishima, a sworn enemy of his clan, has gained possession of the Daikatana, a magical sword that allows its bearer to travel through time. As a result of Mishima's quest for power, a devastating disease is threatening humanity. Hiro and his friends must venture into different time periods, retrieve the sword, and defeat Mishima. \n\n<i>Daikatana</i> is a first-person shooter using the Quake II engine. The game is divided into four episodes of several levels each, each episode taking place in a different time period: far-future Japan, ancient Greece, Dark Ages Norway, and near-future USA. The game uses cutscenes and text to tell the story. Two AI-controlled characters accompany Hiro throughout the quest, helping him in battles and also requiring protection. In addition to several different firearms, the Daikatana itself, which the player acquires in Episode 2, can gain experience and grow stronger as it is used. The game includes a multi-player deathmatch mode.",

The only man that can stop him is the interstellar bounty hunter Dash Rendar. The game is based on the novel of the same name, with locations including ice planet Hoth, Mos Eisley and the sewers of Imperial City, all in full 3D.\n\nLevels each have very different objectives, ranging from piloting snowspeeders on Hoth and racing speeder bikes on Tatooine to shooting stormtroopers and droids on foot throughout the galaxy. Dash primarily uses a blaster with unlimited ammo, but can also find more powerful weapons with limited ammunition. Each level has optional \"challenge points\" that are hidden throughout the level, and finding all of them will unlock a cheat dependent on which difficulty setting the save file is on.",

      "description": "In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...\n\nBarrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.\n\nWhile out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...\n\n<i>Mega Man Legends</i> is the first of the <i>Mega Man</i> series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.",

Every once in a while, you will also use the Blue Marine submarine and the Landmaster tank.\n\nThe 15 levels range from forward scrolling levels (much like <a href=\"/game/panzer-dragoon\">Panzer Dragoon</a> or some elements of Star Wars Arcade) to full 3D arenas, each with a certain goal to achieve or boss to destroy. The bigger your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, which is split into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the final level.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main characters run around with laser cannons.",

      "description": "<i>Bomberman 64</i> is a 3D action platformer. In the game's one-player Adventure mode, marauders have set their sights on Bomberman's peaceful planet. You'll explore labyrinthine levels by dropping bombs, solving puzzles and finding hidden items. The action takes place across five brightly colored worlds: a smoldering volcano, ruined castle, icy mountain range, orbiting space station and storybook village. Find all 100 Gold Cards in the first five worlds and you can access a sixth world. To maximize your score, you'll need to finish each of the 20 levels as quickly as possible. Deadlines are tighter on the Hard difficulty setting. \n\nThe game's multiplayer mode comes in two variations: in Single Battle mode, players dash about arenas, trying to blow each other to pieces. Team Battle mode is a highly explosive version of capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team's gems while protecting your own. You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from three levels of artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. \n\nWhen the Ghost option is selected, your little guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he's gone boom. Ghosts can control a normal Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs. Other features include the possibility to toss or kick your bombs diagonally, the ability to pump up bombs, knock foes unconscious and then grab and toss them.",

      "description": "Conker the Squirrel has had a really bad day. Too much partying, too much booze - and the result is predictable: a terrible hangover. What is less predictable, however, is the fact that Conker has no idea where he is. All he wants is to go home to his girlfriend Berri, but it seems that an unknown force has thrown him into another world. The ruler of said world, the dumb, but vicious Panther King, is having a serious problem: he has been just drinking milk when he discovered that the table in his throne room is missing one of its legs. Unable to solve the problem by himself, the enraged monarch sends for the mad weasel scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, who suggests a red squirrel as a replacement for the table's lost leg. The Panther King sends his minions after Conker, who has to explore the bizarre world, deal with its eccentric characters, stay alive, and find a way to return home.\n\n<i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i> is a grotesque counterpart to Rare's own cheerful, child-oriented 3D action platformers (such as for example Banjo-Kazooie). Intense swearing, violence, and instances of \"toilet humor\" co-exist with cute animals and a brightly colorful fantasy world. The game also contains segments that parody famous movies, such as  The Matrix,  Terminator, and others.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is 3D platform action. Conker can jump, climb, swim, and attack enemies with various weapons (the default one being a frying pan). Conker can also collect money, which is sometimes needed to advance to a new area. The game world is reasonably open, containing an overworld from which the player can access large levels that take a while to explore. Talking to characters and performing tasks offered by them is one of the main devices used to advance the plot and unlock a different area.\n\nA multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay, including a deathmatch, a race, a \"capture the flag\"-like mini-game, etc.",

However, the evil QueenLord, Cassandra, captures him.

Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.\r\n\r\nPresentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).\r\n\r\nHowever, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.\r\n\r\nA 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.",

This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. \n\nThe third title in the <i>Turok</i> series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.\n\n<i>Turok 2</i>'s multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.",

Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives.\n\nMultiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.",

Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy.  There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone.\n\n<i>Rocket: Robot on Wheels</i> is a 3D platformer like no other.  It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, realtime physics.  As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again.  The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose.  In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game.  The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.",

Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.\n\n<i>Jet Force Gemini</i> is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which, as the name implies, is used to feed fish.\n\nEach member of the team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.\n\nThe game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.",

      "description": "Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world.  Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters.\n\n<i>Perfect Dark</i> is a 3D first-person shooter similar to Rare's earlier GoldenEye 007, though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, various explosives, and others.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. Most weapons have secondary fire modes and reloading them is displayed in an on-screen animation. \n\nShields are scattered through the stages and can be picked up for additional protection. There are no health-restoring items and Joanna cannot jump. Like <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, the game has three difficulty levels, with the higher ones featuring more accurate enemies, less ammo, and more objectives for the player to complete within each mission. Cutscenes with voice acting advance the story between missions.\n\nThe game also features a training mode set in the Carrington Institute. Completing the firing range challenge there unlocks the classic weapons from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.  In addition, the campaign can be played in a co-operative mode for two human players or one human player and up to three computer-controlled teammates (in split-screen mode), as well as in a \"Counter Operative\" mode, where one of the players takes control of an enemy and tries to stop Joanna from fulfilling her mission. \n\nMultiplayer includes a variety of modes. Among those are the traditional deathmatch as well as the objective-based Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. Other scenarios and objectives include surviving as long as possible while carrying a briefcase, hacking computer systems with randomly placed data uplinks, and hunting down a single player as a team. Stages, teams, and weapon placement can be customized by players.\n\nThe Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.",

      "description": "Famed SNES racer F-Zero gets a 64-bit update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.\n\nWhile the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a l\u00e1 Mario Kart 64.\n\nGone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the \"X\" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.\n\nOne of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</i> is a story-driven fighting game that casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that occurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nIn a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.\n\nGameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting environment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a \"use\" and \"turn around\" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight RPG twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.\n\nTechnically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3D lighting as well as 3D backgrounds and characters, etc.",

The player's task is to finally rid the universe of all the crazy hellions, from the dead guy with the pistol to the rocket-spewing Cyberdemon.\n\nThe game is very different from the original DOOM; it has larger sprites, pseudo 3D, new textures, scrolling skies, custom scripting which allows for morphing environments, spawning items and new character animations.

      "description": "The year is 2016. Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\n\n<i>Body Harvest</i> is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.\n\nEach vehicle has its own speed, armor, and fuel capacity attributes. Controllable vehicles range from armored cars and tanks to boats, helicopters, planes, and even a space ship during a few missions. Buildings scattered around levels may contain useful items, ammunition, and fuel. The player has to avoid killing innocent people; too many casualties result in a premature end of the game. Typically, the main goals in each area are to destroy the alien Shield Generator, defeat a boss enemy, and proceed to the next stage.",

Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.\n\n<i>Bangai-O</i> is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups. \n\n",

Play solo through the grand prix, or beat down your best times in the time trial mode. \n\nEach track features a number of twists and turns, whether it be racing upside down or vertically, with a number of obstacles in your path. There's no weapons, though, it's just you and the open road ahead.",

After its launch into space, the station vanished, never to be seen again.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time.\n\nSadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog.\n\nAs you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo's chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers.\n\nAims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action.\n\nWhen the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.",

Power-ups and items can be picked up to increase your shooting and speed ability, and the further you go in the game, the more enemies attack and the more difficult it gets to save the humans.\r\n\r\nOptions include the ability to plug in a second N64 controller for added control of the character on the game screen (i.e. two analog sticks). The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled graphics that hark back to the 80's classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the character.",

But by getting some air and landing through rings, or pulling off stunts, you'll also pick up coins that will go towards upgrading your car.\r\n\r\nThe cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly.\r\n\r\nA 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.

Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come.\n\nThe N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game.\n\nIf the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood War expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.",

It covers the major battles from the entire <i>Evangelion</i> saga and features original footage from the anime. \n\nIn <i>Story Mode</i> the player takes control of bio-mechanical mechas called Evas to fight against monstrous beings called Angels. To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and grappling techniques are available at the pilot's disposal. Depending on the damage the player's Eva takes and if certain parameters are met during that time the player will be given a time limit in which they must end the battle with the Angel. \n\nThe <i>Simulation Mode</i> almost plays like a shooter. It\u2019s a 1st-person perspective mode where the player must eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit. When the time limit ends a rank is assigned depending on how many enemies were destroyed and how many bullets were used.",

      "description": "The basic concept remains unchanged in this N64 installment of the series - it's a turned based strategy game where the player commands robots and pilots from various Japanese shows, for example Dancouga and different Gundam series, as well as Banpresto originals. Newly introduced are Six God Combination Godmars, Giant Robo and Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player is offered a choice out of four pairs of protagonists/rivals, which affects the plot and the stages played. With the different variations included, there are over 100 missions.\n\nDuring the stages, the player moves his units over a map, attacking enemies and using special abilities. When getting attacked, player units may defend, counter, or attempt to evade, resulting in no damage at all if successful. Destroyed enemies give experience and money for upgrading between the missions. Often, scripted events happen, such as reinforcements arriving. Sometimes it's also possible to persuade certain characters to join the player's side, in addition to those that join automatically. Certain, otherwise unobtainable units, can also be unlocked by using the N64 Transfer Pak in combination with the Gameboy Color game <i>Super Robot Wars: Link Battler</i>.",

      "description": "<i>Super Robot Spirits</i> is a one-against-one fighting game featuring big robots from the <i>Super Robot Wars</i> game series and anime TV series. The background story is basically about an mysterious force attacking Earth and the robot pilots battle it out to determine who fights the evil robots in the end. How the story plays out in detail depends on which of the seven characters is used in story mode. The selectable characters are the protagonists' mecha from the series <i>Daitarn 3</i>, <i>Dancougar</i>, <i>G Gundam</i>, <i>Dunbine</i>, <i>Xabungle</i> and <i>Voltes V</i> plus the R-1 from Shin Super Robot Taisen. By meeting certain conditions while playing, three more characters can be unlocked, including one that makes its debut in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself follows the genre standards: both opponents can perform a set of standard and special attacks (the latter executed with certain button combinations). Every hit causes the energy bar to go down and whoever runs out first, loses. When a timer runs out, the one with the most energy left wins. Each fighter also has a second energy meter which can be used to perform especially powerful attacks. The robots also can fly which changes the available attack range. The playing modes are story, vs (two players), 64 (same as story mode without the story), Guts (fighting one opponent after another until the energy runs out), time attack (defeating opponents in a short time) and training.",

      "description": "<i>Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue</i> is one of several different games based on the 2000 incarnation of the franchise. This time, the Power Rangers are recruited to protect the city of Mariner Bay against the evil Diabolico and his minions.\n\nThe game's main story mode is called Titanium Quest and consists of three episodes that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of a number of missions, for over 30 missions in total. The missions are of one of four different types.\n\nThe Ranger levels are seen from an angled top-down perspective. A pre-determined Ranger is tasked with either rescuing a number of innocents or removing dangerous obstacles within a time limit. A radar map shows the way to the next objective. Enemy goons that stand in the way can be taken out by shooting an energy burst. Power-ups can be collected that enable more powerful shots, short-time invisibility or enhanced armor, health upgrades and more. Occasionally, the Ranger levels feature boss fights against more powerful enemies.\n\nThe driving levels are seen from the side. A Ranger-controlled vehicle drives from left to right and must put out fires, rescue civilians or clean up radioactive spills while avoiding traffic and shooting at enemy vehicles. There is a time limit and power-ups can be collected to restore health lost through attacks or crashes.\n\nThe Megazord levels are one-on-one battles that pit the Ranger's Megazord mech against one powerful boss enemy. Perspective can be switched between first- and third-person. The goal is to destroy the enemy with missiles or, if close enough, with melee attacks. Blocking is possible and power-ups can be picked up to restore health or increase firepower.\n\nThe final type of level are flying levels in which players control the Green Ranger's hovercraft. In these, the goal is once more to rescue innocents or alternatively, collect a number of items. The hovercraft is seen from behind and can freely move through a 3D environment. As in the Ranger levels, there is a radar map that shows the way to the next objective and a time limit.\n\nA two-player mode is also available, which consists of a split-screen variant of the Megazord battles. Characters to use in this mode must be unlocked by progressing in the single-player game.\n\nComic-style illustrations advance the storyline between levels.",
